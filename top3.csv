AbuIlyaas,"al-salamu 'alaykum ,  This is one of my favourite lectures by Jamal al-Din Zarabozo ( hafizhahullah ) and is one that I feel is still very relevant today. It was given in 1997 at the height of a lot of  fitna , name-calling and division. His sincerity comes across in his words and I found this lecture very moving when I first heard it.     &quot;Priorities of Bearing the Message - The Manners of Differing&quot;     Part One:   http://www.yousendit.com/transfer.ph...34685B3EB293C6   Part Two:   http://www.yousendit.com/transfer.ph...CC1AD63B276769"

AbuIlyaas,"Alhamdu lillaah , they seem to have taken on board our critique of their document and are going to change the primary complaint we had and they will look through the rest of the corrections that we suggested. It seemed quite positive overall and I've been invited to some faith in the workplace forum.  One bit made me smile, when one manager was discussing how they need their document to be sensitive to other faiths and he mentioned how, in places, he would like to adjust the words I'd used, &quot;... for example, here you have said,  The Day when humanity will be resurrected and judged by Allah according to their beliefs and actions. The succesful will be granted Paradise and the unsuccessful will be given Hell-fire as an abode , well, um, you see, people don't tend to use language like that nowadays, all that fire and brimstone kind of thing, some people from other faiths might, well, they might, take offense to something like that ...&quot; :D"

I'm pretty sure the Cadbury's version still circulates with a suitable for vegetarians disclaimer.  Gelatine can come from different sources so it is feasible that they could be halal. Plus I feel more relaxed when I see the country of origin is a Muslim country as then it opens the doors to greater confidence that beef based gelatine has come from Islamicly slaughtered cows."

AbuIlyaas,"Maybe if you wait until it's up on Upon Sunnah, Abu Umar tends to shrink the file size before he uploads it to their library. So it might be quicker then. I just record and boost the volume, I don't mess around with file size."
AbuIlyaas,"In addition to that over usage of sorry I picked up another form of misapplication, from my non-English wife. Her family appears to use &quot;Sorry&quot; as short for &quot;I feel sorry for you.&quot;  So for instance one might say, &quot;That man's dog just mauled my leg off!&quot; Where the reply would be &quot;Sorry&quot; despite having no ownership over said dog.  So I spent the first couple of years of married life regularly clarifying to various family members who'd say &quot;sorry&quot; after I'd say &quot;I'm tired&quot; or one of my children would fall over and hurt themselves, &quot;No need to apologise, it wasn't your fault.&quot;  I eventually gave up and joined in and now it's ingrained in me, to the extent that I apply it at work without even thinking and now people look at me bemused and ask, &quot;What you saying sorry for?&quot;"
AbuIlyaas,"wa 'alaykum salam wa rahmatullah  Ok, sorry but I don't know of a jeweller in London that does that.    Quote:     Originally Posted by  Umm Luay   However, the problem is that I have gold, some of which is 22 carat, or 21, or 9, and also some white gold - so, it is not all pure gold.

I'm curious though, have you been given a fatwa that suggests you need to distinguish between the carats of the various items of jewellery when you're weighing them?   I'm just asking because I recall when I discussed the issue of jewellery with a mixed content (i.e. I was asking about a watch which wasn't completely gold) with the brother Abu Hanifah (he sometimes give fatwa on the Islam Channel and who, incidentally, holds that there is no zakah on jewellery) many years ago, I remember him telling me to just estimate it."

AbuIlyaas,Ta-da!    [Very definately in English. Cost me ?5 from Dar al-Taqwa]
AbuIlyaas,"I really should be doing something else   but ...    I tried searching about rep points and I got some info from the  vBulletin manual :    ? Adminstrators can have reputation power separate from their calculated score. Which I took to mean there isn't the  'you must spread some reputation around before giving it to fulaan again ' restriction on them, that others have.    ?  Things that can affect your reputation  power  (i.e. to give/take rep) include: Your registration date; your post count; your number of reputation points; restrictions placed by admins such as having minimum numbers of reputation points or post counts before you can give out rep; daily restrictions on the amount of rep passed out; and restriction on user spread, i.e. there is a set amount of users you must spread rep to before you can re-rep someone   [I think this is set too high on this site because I can't re-rep anyone at the moment until I pick someone new to rep and I don't feel like rep-ing someone new yet]      Then from other sites I learnt that:    ?  Some sites allow you to 'steal' others' points. ???     ?  There are various hacks you can do like to make user's rep-point total be displayed publically. And on  this site  they made it so that when someone gives a message with a rep rating, then that message is also displayed publically in the relevant post, as well as who said it. This could prove interesting, especially if, as this thread suggests, people are using the system as means to private message!    Phew! Now, who's going to be the first one to tell me to get a life?"

AbuIlyaas,"wa 'alaykum salam wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh ,   Jazakum Allahu khayran  Asim for your penetrating words. Our brother Talha touched and affected many of us here and elsewhere, and he is certainly sorely missed.   Even in his present circumstances I feel sure that the strength of his character will shine brightly through and continue to be an example to us of steadfastness and unwavering commitment to seeking Allah's pleasure.  I ask Allah (' azza wa jall ) that He bring from these trials much benefits and that He raise from our ranks many more defenders of the  oppressed, so that through returning to our Lord, we are able to lift the many wrongs that we witness daily inflicted upon our Ummah."

AbuIlyaas,Islam Today also had a brief look at this topic  here .
AbuIlyaas,"I haven't bought any for a while but  al-hidaayah  in Birmingham are stocking a lot of the US recorded lectures like the Emanrush and al-Huda stuff.   Ahlussunnah  have an exclusive set of recordings.  Other than that I like what  Qadimoon  are doing, remastering a lot of cassette lectures onto CDs that may have otherwise been lost."
AbuIlyaas,Please be advised that Shaykh Isam doesn't read any posts outside of the  &quot;Ask the Scholar&quot;  section and so he won't have seen your question here.  You are most welcome to ask it as a question in that section if you so wish.

It might depend on what you initially say you want to go for, i.e. the degree or just some random study. You'd better check with them first.   But it is better to not start a module and halfway through the term decide you want to postpone it, as it can restrict the maximum grade you can get for that module."

It's also interesting to note how Pride will let a fight continue long after a UFC ref would have stopped it. Again, suggesting that they are more culturally accepting of pain."
AbuIlyaas,Here is the previous answer Shaykh isam gave:   Rights of non-Muslims upon us.

AbuIlyaas,"wa `alaikum Salaam,   I thought she was Qadiyani? I seem to remember reading where she referred to herself as an Ahmadi Muslim, but it could have been Ismaili. It'd involve paying a subscription fee to the independent to check my memory - and she  ain't  worth spending any money on.   Did anyone see her on the Channel 4 news around the time when that sister from Luton ( hafizhahaa Allaah ) had been expelled from school for wearing her  abayaa ? Yasmin was interviewed along with the lawyer of the sister. I was absolutely fuming :mad: listening to her speak.    She was essentially attacking the sister for wanting to observe the command of Allaah. And when the lawyer mentioned that the sister did so because she believed that the options that the school offereed were immodest.   AliBhai-Brown launched into this tirade, &quot;Immodest! Immodest! I mean can anyone look at me and describe what I am wearing as immodest? [she was wearing a dress with her neck upwards exposed]&quot;   Well Miss AliBhai-Whatever, in answer to your question I allude to a short three letter word that succinctly covers your query, it rhymes with 'yes' and it contains the letters 'Y', 'E' and 'S' in it."
AbuIlyaas,"Sas,  I'm getting that problem again where emails I send to GMail accounts (I tried to reply to your last email) from my IN account are returned with delivery failure.  Last time it happened you told me that you'd received it even though I got a failed delivery message."
AbuIlyaas,"wa `alaikum salam wa rahmatullah wa barakatuh,   There were some lengthy discussions last night about it and some criticisms were raised. I appreciate that many of you may have enjoyed it and so allow me to apologise to anyone who feels put out by this.  In the interest of us not returning to extended discussions, it may be better for me not to elucidate further. I hope you can accept this as an answer to &quot;why?&quot;, as I would be reluctant to respond to further enquiries.  If any brother wants a particular part that was relevant to them copied and sent to them then they can pm me and I'll oblige. I'm sure the female moderators would likewise be happy to, if a sister wanted her question and answer retrieved.  Sorry for any inconvenience caused."
AbuIlyaas,"Firstly, jazakum Allahu khayran, for fixing whatever it was that blocked my access to the site a couple of days ago.   Some problems I'm having:   The &quot;To:&quot; button in compose mail hasn't been working for me for some days now. It just never seems to redirect to the address book like it used to. I normally just give up waiting and hit &quot;address book&quot; to select who I'm sending to.  I also still can't send mail through Outlook Express from my IN account. I can receive mail through OE but if I want to send from my IN account, then I have to physically go to the site through a browser."
AbuIlyaas,I asked a male colleague and he gave these answers (I'm compiling it here for my own reference).  1. &quot;Sorry?&quot; 2. Toilet. 3. Napkin. 4. Lunch and Dinner. 5. Settee. 6. Living Room 7. Dessert.

After numerous arguments between him and other users and it becoming clear that he was here purely to assert the superiority of the Afghan people over other races that has Allah created we opted to ban him.  I banned him again just now because he was banned before and to just change your username and then return with the same spiel will result in the same response.  If I thought that others here would debate him with the patience and manners that I'm sure you would then I'd leave him be, but past experience showed that his presence on the board was a moderatoring nightmare and it was much easier to manage with him removed from sight.

AbuIlyaas,"Someone educate me, what would be an Arabic equivalent of the word nerd?   Yeah, another  alif   laam   meem  thing is where someone extends the  kasrah  in alif into a long  yaa,  when they butcher an attempt at  tajweed:    aleef    laam   meem , doesn't it change the meaning to pet?"
AbuIlyaas,"Prof, your post baffled me. I was reading it asking myself, why would Prof write &quot;abvious&quot;? Surely, he'd have wrote the &quot;O&quot;? Maybe it was a mis-keying? No, the &quot;O&quot; and the &quot;A&quot; are very far apart!   And so I was trying to make excuses to myself for this un-Prof-like behaviour.

I have heard that it is permissible because it is safer to travel now and that a group of pious sisters can act - so to speak- as the &quot;mahram&quot; of each other.  Jezak Allah khayr"
AbuIlyaas,"Yeah I saw that too, it looks like the bendy bit is only over the bridge of the nose though. I guess it's so you can fall asleep with them on without awaking to find some bizarre new shape."
AbuIlyaas,"al-salamu 'alaykum,  Does anyone have any Islamic or Islamically compliant short plays that we could have some primary school children enact for a school presentation?  I'm looking for existing plays/resources more than ideas for new ones but the latter would also be acceptable."

AbuIlyaas,"AsSalaamu alaikum,   I'm growing weary of the PC my Dad gave me, many years ago, crashing on me. There's no 'pentium inside', and the printer only works because I stuck a lump of blu-tac in a critical position to give it a couple more months of life.   Basically I'm thinking of starting from scratch.   I know next to nothing about computers so please try not to baffle me with too much specification info.   I'm asking what to get and where to get it (I live in London).   Does anywhere do interest free credit so that I could spread the payments out?   I mainly use it for word processing, but I'd like a scanner, printer, CD writer, DVD playable, a bluetooth connection so I can use my phone-photos, I would want windows, excel, a firewall, etc. I'm not sure on how much I'd be willing to spend, if I can spread the payments out, it'd be more - so I'm open to suggestions as to what sort of figure would give me what I needed.   Also, what word processors would anyone recommend where I can use both English and Arabic script. I currently use Corel Word Perfect 8 for my assignments, which is quite a labourious task with all the 'insert symbols' it takes.   Any advice?"

Is there a quick way to change a PC over into displaying commands/prompts in English?"

I didn't listen to any of the lectures (I've only heard three in total over the many years I've gone). It's not a form of boycott, I just always seem to be doing other stuff.

The one I shopped at was on Upton Lane but it shut down with no explanation about four years ago. I wonder if it just moved to the address that you cited?

AbuIlyaas,"As you notice your sins mounting up in number, you can start to despair over the heavy load that you are carrying with you into the Hereafter.

AbuIlyaas,Shaykh Isam has answered a similar question here:   http://talk.islamicnetwork.com/showthread.php?t=9462
AbuIlyaas,"Quote:     Originally Posted by  talib-fil-Islam   in terms of ur point br. abuIlyas, from my understanding, one of the prayers in one of the garments is not accepted b/c one of the garments is haram. that is why u would pray in both b/c we dont know which garment is the haram one.     Yeah, I understood this reasoning but my concern was that a person was intending to make a  fardh   salaah  twice. Shouldn't the prohibition take precedence over the doubt?   Looking at  salaah, there are two separate issues. The obligation to estabilsh it and the issue of whether it is accepted or not. Look at the case of the one whose  salaah  is not accepted for 40 days after a particular sin (can't remember which) has been committed, he still has to make the  salaah  despite it not being accepted. He still has to discharge the obligation to pray.   So how can, in our example, the individual pray twice with the intention to fulfil this obligation in the presence of a prohibition to repeat the  salaah ?   I'm just thinking aloud here. I'm sure the truth is with al-Shinqeetee and al-'Uthaimeen I'm just trying to grasp the details."
AbuIlyaas,"In addition to that over usage of sorry I picked up another form of misapplication, from my non-English wife. Her family appears to use &quot;Sorry&quot; as short for &quot;I feel sorry for you.&quot;  So for instance one might say, &quot;That man's dog just mauled my leg off!&quot; Where the reply would be &quot;Sorry&quot; despite having no ownership over said dog.  So I spent the first couple of years of married life regularly clarifying to various family members who'd say &quot;sorry&quot; after I'd say &quot;I'm tired&quot; or one of my children would fall over and hurt themselves, &quot;No need to apologise, it wasn't your fault.&quot;  I eventually gave up and joined in and now it's ingrained in me, to the extent that I apply it at work without even thinking and now people look at me bemused and ask, &quot;What you saying sorry for?&quot;"

AbuIlyaas,"al-hamdu lillah,  'MENT' recently got prosecuted.

He was caught, amongst other things, scratching 'Ment' on a train window. That's the kind of talentless stuff that I dislike!  I think I've got some Banksy work next to my street, there are rat silhouhettes stuck on these traffic cone things (they're not traffic cones but I've forgotten their names. It's a hip height white box, with yellow sides, a blue keep right arrow, a light inside, and they sit on little islands) with each cone also having an ascending number on it.

AbuIlyaas,"Other moments:   *   Pride  3  has two class moments:   - The commentary on the Emanuel Yarbrough vs Daijyu Takase fight. Emanuel (who also appeared in UFC 3) is a 600lb Sumo Wrestler. Daijyu Takase is this 170lb Japanese guy. The commentary by Bas Ruten and Steven Qyadros during the fight is just plain hilarious.   - There is another funny moment for me in this event, during the Gary Goodridge v Amir Rahnavardi fight, the commentator Steven Quadros accidently mentions who is going to win the fight. Bas the other commentator says in reply, &quot;er ... they'll have to edit that, because we're right here man!&quot; i.e. they were dubbing the commentary after the fight not that it was a fixed fight.    * In UFC 43 , Randy Couture beats Chuck Liddel for the interim Light Heavy Weight belt. Eddie Bravo interviews him in the ring. He's full of praise for Randy, &quot;Well Randy you've beat Chuck now ...&quot; etc. Randy is reall happy. Then Eddie concludes the interview by saying to Randy &quot;Congratulations Chuck!&quot; There is this really funny exchange of looks as Randy looks at Eddie and you can just see the expression on his face &quot;my name's Randy not Chuck.&quot; While there is a flash of realisation on Eddie's face as and he quickly just turns to the camera and does this &quot;make some noise&quot; bit to cover his mistake.   * Pride 2000 Grand Prix:  There is another classic moment that is supposed to very funny when Mark Coleman wins the Pride 2000 Grand Prix. I've only seen the opening rounds and haven't got a copy of the finals yet. When he wins he's supposed to jump on the ropes in celebration but he falls really badly instead, it's supposed to be a howler.   To NaseehaMan: Nice technique, but I won't be using it myself, ouch!"
AbuIlyaas,"I keep meeting American tourists (at work) who ask, &quot;Do you have a bathroom?&quot; So I reply, &quot;downstairs on the left but there's no bathing facilities - only a toilet.&quot;   But I guess it's boredom that leads me to it because when I get a similar query from someone British, &quot;Hey mate! Have you got any loos?&quot; I'll say, &quot;Yes, we've got a Bakerloo and a Waterloo.&quot;    (And I'm not a toilet attendant by profession, in case anyone was wondering.)"

AbuIlyaas,"ITS referred to him as a S.O.B. ( here ) but I didn't notice any takfeer of him, Zaid Shakir wasn't even mentioned in their 32 &quot;Scholars to avoided&quot; list.

Even Abu Hamza al-Misri was asked about him ( here ) and concluded &quot;  Best to stay away from him but not to call him a kaffir.&quot;  So I would interested to know which noteworthy people of knowledge have pronounced takfeer on Hamza Yusuf and Zaid Shakir."

AbuIlyaas,"Sister, I'd advise you not to seek answers to these questions over the internet but rather to go a qualified  qadhi  (judge) in your area.   Whilst your questions may be general there is a likelihood that they'd implemented in a specific case, a judge needs to look into various issues concerning specific situations in order to give the appropriate ruling.  If you do not know of someone in your locality perhaps you could post the areas that are commutable for you (either here or in the sisters' section) and someone could recommend or suggest a judge that deals with issues such as custody, etc.  Allahu a'lam"
AbuIlyaas,"In shaa' Allaah , we've got him!   Well, not the guy that the original story is about but another scum bag.   This one regualrly hurls verbal abuse at me and threatens me with violence.

I just stood still looking at him and not saying anything. After he'd run out of names to call me, he did that  kkccchaah  noise, that means someone's preparing to spit. Then he looked into my eyes and for a second I was scared he wasn't going to spit. I had to stop myself from saying &quot;do it then!&quot;   Then he spat all over me and internally I was saying, &quot; al-hamdu lillaah , we've got him now!&quot; I just walked off and got one of the DNA spit kits that we have for occassions like this to 'preserve the evidence'.    He normally abuses me out of ear shot of people but tonight he did this in front of two witnesses, plus we've got DNA evidence! :D    So,  in shaa' Allaah , this scum bag will be picked up soon. As much as I'd have liked to thump him, I'd derive greater pleasure form seeing him locked up or have an ASBO put out on him,  heh !"

AbuIlyaas,Jamal Zarabozo discussed this incident in a lecture on organ donation but said that there doesn't appear to be any authenticity to it.   He mentioned that a gathering of hay'at kibar al-'ulama including Abdul-Aziz bin Baz looked at the reports of this and declared that there was no authentic chain ( isnad ) for this story whatsoever.
AbuIlyaas,"Quote:     Originally Posted by  UmmKhubayb   I guess you are unaware of his fatwa allowing the najjis american troops into the arabian peninsula to spill Muslim blood?     I'm not saying that I agree with his fatwa but it has been argued that he was following the position of the Hanbali madhhab.  e.g. Abuz Zubair mentioned it once in  a lengthy post  that I enjoyed reading on as-Sahwah.    Quote:    As for Sh Ibn Baz allowing the American troops in the Arabian Peninsula, then it is just a matter of Fiqhi dispute. Ibn Qudamah is of the opinion, and it is the correct position in the Hanbali Madhab, that it is permissible for the ruler to seek help from the Mushrikin against Mushrikin in case of necessity. His Fatwa was about nothing but the Fiqhi ruling. This is why he wasn抰 criticised by Sh Safar and others on the ruling of seeking aid from the Mushrikin itself. Rather, he was criticised for his inaccurate view on the status quo of the Middle East and the American agenda behind stationing its troops in the Gulf. It was never a matter of Kufr and Iman, the way some people have made it out to be. On the other hand, Sheikh al-Albani was extremely critical of Sh Ibn Baz抯 view and he was so outspoken that I think, his views caused him to be banned from entering Saudi again. Moreover, Sh Ibn Baz wasn抰 the only scholar to have signed the Fatwa, rather it was also the great Deobandi Indian scholar Abul-Hasan al-Nadawi. Hence, the Fatwa wasn抰 a big issue in terms of its Fiqhi nature, but it was problematic with respect to its application in reality, which greatly varied from people to people as to how they viewed American hidden agendas, and at what length they thought the Americans would go, and whether inviting the Americans along with their agendas is a greater harm than letting Saddam roll his tanks into Arabia and crushing the Dawah with full force."

AbuIlyaas,"Quote:     had taken other wives and flaunted his infidelity    I don't think infidelity would be the correct term for polygamy as this is a lawful practice. The term should, in my opinion, be restricted to the case of the philanderer and his ilk, whose lack of faithfulness takes him into the unlawful."
AbuIlyaas,"Maa shaa' Allaah , may Allaah hasten our brother's release.   And, I hadn't heard of this bit before:     Quote:    And so Saad (RA) proceeded to fight the Persians and, sticking to the advice of his leader, he imprisoned the alcoholic Abu Mahjan Ath-Thaqafi lest his presence in the army delays the victory. Until, Abu Mahjan lamented in his shackles and composed verses of poetry that touched the wife of Saad (RA) to temporarily release him so that he could participate in the battle with his brothers. Abu Mahjan thus went out riding the horse of Saad (RA) (as Saad (RA) was bedridden with fever) and performed unmatched feats of valour before returning to his cell in the evening and wearing his shackles back by himself. This continued for three days until, when Saad (RA) found out about the heroics of Abu Mahjan, he untied his shackles with the words: 揃y Allah! I will never imprison you again for drinking alcohol!?Upon this, Abu Mahjan replied, 揃y Allah! I will never again touch alcohol after this day!?The army was victorious and Saad (RA) appointed the ascetic Companion Salman Al-Farsi (RA) as the new ruler of Persia, who lived on a meagre salary of one dirham per day."
AbuIlyaas,Another factor in it could be who is going to pay? If it was your sister's turn to pay then it'd perhaps be wiser to wait a bit longer before ordering in case she gets upset and you end up picking up the bill.
AbuIlyaas,"Jazakum Allahu khayran , I  just  made it to CJM in time.  I was walking along King Street and then I saw this to my left:     And I thought to myself &quot;It's a bit Indian looking&quot; but figured &quot;it must be it.&quot; That's the thing with directions and the brain, there comes a point where the brain just kicks in and says &quot;Heh, leave it to me, I can work this out for myself&quot; and the words &quot;Green Dome&quot; and &quot;HSBC Bank&quot; become relegated to some unused brain cell towards the back.  So I'm happily walking along towards this Sikh temple when I spot some Muslim with a green kufi walking in the opposite direction, I'm thinking &quot;Dude, it's jumu'ah and you're walking  away  from the masjid?&quot; So I stopped in the street and did some tennis fan head movements, white temple - green Kufi, white temple - green kufi, white temple - I  think  ... I'd  better...   follow  ... the green kufi. So yeah, I got there in the end but it was close.  Note: The directions were perfect, it was me that sucks."

AbuIlyaas,"Fiqh Class - Sacramento, California      This was an open fiqh circle that Shaykh 'Ali held, where he gave detailed answers to whatever questions that were put to him.

AbuIlyaas,"Ok, I'll retract my &quot;attitude&quot; and delete my posts. Please accept my apologies for any harm caused."
AbuIlyaas,"Jazaka Allahu khayran  for mentioning this  Sunnah akhi .  The thing that really struck me about when you do this in a  masjid  is that it let's you see who's who in your local  masjid .   As the  salah  finishes and the people start to leave one by one, take note of which brothers hang around to implement this particular hadith.   In my experience, it's not the zealous young brother with the big beard who's implementing other  sunan  left, right and centre. The one that normally sits patiently until the sun rises and prays as the hadith mentions is the old man in the  masjid  that the youth sometimes look down upon and think he's steeped in  bid'ah ; or it's the clean shaven brother that we normally equate with being too busy with his business to come to the  masjid .  So for me it just goes to show that we shouldn't judge others or dismiss their efforts because whilst they might not be observing particular  sunan  that we're observing, they may very well be taking advantage of other acts of worship that we sometimes neglect.

AbuIlyaas,"And in the  animal quiz , I'm quite reassuringly a  human !     You're a Human!    With extreme power comes extreme destructiveness, and you've had plenty of both to share with your peers. While you're capable of a great deal of beauty and joy, your skill in creating misery seems almost boundless at times. You've made a big fuss about how you're smarter than everyone else, but all they can see is how you've used those smarts for ill. At this point, your best hope is to turn to those around you and start caring about them. It would also be advisable to get rid of some of your stuff, and preferably not by throwing it away."
AbuIlyaas,"Conclusion   From the above, the conclusions that can be made are the following:  (1) There are explicit hadith from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that show that zakaat is to be levied upon such jewelry.  (2) In the face of those hadith, the different opinions of the Companions need not be considered as perhaps it was just the case that some of them did not hear about the Prophet's commands on this issue.  (3) There is no proof that the Prophet's orders for zakaat on jewelry were abrogated. Indeed, the original case was no zakaat at all, in general, and on jewelry, in particular. Therefore, the argument of abrogation is in need of proof.  (4) There is no call to resort to qiyaas (analogy) in the presence of explicit texts from the Prophet (peace be upon him).  Therefore, zakaat is obligatory on jewelry every year once the amount reaches the nisaab and has been in the possession of the woman for one year. This is the opinion of the following scholars: Abdullah ibn Masood, Aishah, Saeed ibn Jubair, Saeed ibn al-Musayyab, Jaabir ibn Zaid, Maimun ibn Mahran, Muhammad ibn Sireen, Mujaahid, al-Zuhri, Ata ibn Abu Ribah, Abdullah ibn Shidaad, Ibraaheem al-Nakhai, al-Dhuhaak, Abu Haneefah, Sufyaan al-Thauri, al-Auzaaee, Abdullah ibn al-Mubaarak, ibn Shibrima, al-Tahaawi, Daawood ibn Ali al-Dhaahiri, ibn Hazm, ibn al-Mundhir, al-Raazi, al-Sanaani, Abdul Azeez ibn Baaz, Muhammad ibn Uthaimeen and Ahmad al-Banna.(*3)  The scholars are agreed, by the way, that there is no zakaat on diamonds, pearls, rubies, chrysolite and other similar precious stones, unless they are for the purpose of business in which case they fall under the category of zakaat on merchandise. Furthermore, the above difference of opinion is only concerning legal jewelry. If the woman owns, for example, men's jewelry or ornaments, such as a sword, then she is obliged to pay zakaat on them.   __________  (*3) See al-Basaarah, pp. 15-26, for the respective references for these scholars' opinions."

AbuIlyaas,"Did I mention that it was traditional ladies clothing?     Quote:    Michael Jackson抯 toilet faux pas in Dubai By Amira Agarib   13 November 2005      DUBAI ?When she went to the ladies washroom in the Egyptian Court of Ibn Battuta Mall at 9.30 last night, 37-year old Latifa M. never imagined that she would come face to face with pop icon Michael Jackson, who walked in dressed in a T-shirt and trousers, with his head covered with the Emirati women抯 traditional head scarf Sheila.      The Tunisian, who is a teacher in a private school in Dubai, screamed in shock and ran out of the ladies room when she realised that the woman-like person was a man. She went back in to photograph the pop singer with her mobile phone, while he was busy fixing his make up.      This time it was the turn of Michael Jackson who ran after the Ajman-based teacher, to retrieve the pictures. The scene attracted the security of the mall, who tried to take the phone from Latifa, but she refused and asked for compensation, while the two women accompanying Jackson tried to convince her to sit in private and settle the issue.      Wary of this suggestion, the teacher called the police. Colonel Abdul Jalil Al Mehdi, Deputy Director of the Preventive Security Department of Dubai Police, took the matter in his hands and tried to solve the issue, while Jackson left it to his companions to explain who he is and solve the matter.     While Latifa insisted on compensation, Jackson flatly refused to pay up. The police informed Latifa that the UAE laws do not entitle her to any financial gain from the situation and they convinced her to hand over the mobile, which she did after erasing the photos for the fear of being penalised.       source"

Contact lenses seem a bit intimidating at the moment. It's probably a child hood association with the feeling you get when your mother tries to fish a stray eyelash out of your eye with the corner of a handkerchief.      I also once saw an episode of the Simpsons where Homer had the laser surgery bit and then his eyes crusted over when he didn't use the drops. Which is nonsense, I know, but it put me off.   So I guess I'm stuck with glasses.   I've noticed that there seems to be some sort of correlation between taking my glasses off and short term memory. It seems like a matter of seconds after having taken my glasses off, to make  wudhoo  for instance, before they'll totally disappear from my memory and the next time I'll be aware that they are missing is when my children come running with them - complete with grubby fingerprints on the lenses and slightly mangled frames. :huh:"

When I was mid-air I kind of realised that the ditch was a lot wider and deeper (and full of water) than I first thought and I panicked a bit and landed badly.  But what can I say except for Qadar Allahu wa masha'a fa'l."
AbuIlyaas,"From al-Bukhari .    Narrated Abu Huraira:             The Prophet ( Sallaahu `alaihi wa sallam ) said, &quot;A believer is not stung twice (by something) out of      one and the same hole.&quot;     Quote:     Originally Posted by  Prof    &quot;Fool me once, shame on you.

AbuIlyaas,Akhi LivingUnderMercy Of Allah posted a riddle by Einstein on Upon Sunnah forums.   I've removed the references to alcohol and smoking and am reposting it here:   Happy Solving:       Einstein Riddle              Einstein said that 98% of the people in the world cannot solve his riddle. Are you among the other 2%?              Try it out!

AbuIlyaas,Well Bob certainly was.
AbuIlyaas,"No but once when I was very young and we were walking in a forest with our parents, I picked up a pinecone to show my mum. My younger brother tried to compete with me and bring mum a nicer one, but trust me his  wasn't  a pinecone.    Let's just say it's also an area that people walk their dogs."
AbuIlyaas,"Just wanted to mention this regarding two questions posed to Shaykh Isam ( Q1 ,  Q2 )  In the UK there is a widely available mouthwash that   does not   contain alcohol.       Dentyl pH         Quote:    * Long-lasting - effective for up to 18 hours after a single use.  *   Alcohol-free    - most mouthrinses contain alcohol, drying the mouth.  * Fluoride - to strengthen teeth and prevent decay.  * Helps fight plaque and protects teeth and gums.  * Same pH balance as saliva unlike some mouthrinses which are acidic and can damage the mouth - Dentyl pH does not.  * Designed by the world's leading expert in breath odour.    Are you guys absolutely  sure   that there isn't a similar product available in US? I would have thought a consumer mad society like the US would have something like this if we do."
AbuIlyaas,It makes me write things here.
AbuIlyaas,"al-salaamu `alaikum,   Here's a question that's been bugging me for some time (I cut'n'pasted it from my al-maghrib posts. I can't remember if I've ever asked it here before, if I have then I have forgotten the answer):    Soorah al-Bayyinah    Is there any significance to the inclusion of the word ' Abadan ' in  ayaah  8, compared to  ayaa h 6 where it is not used.   In  Ayaah  six it's  'khaalideena feehaa'  describing the disbelievers in the hell fire. Translated as &quot;... and  al-Mushrikun  will abide in the Fire of Hell.&quot;    In Ayaah  eight it's  'khaalideena feehaa abadan'  describing the believers in Paradise. Translated as &quot;... They will abide therein forever, ...&quot;   From the English the difference seems to be the additional 'forever' referring to the believers' abiding. But isn't the disbelievers' abiding in Hell fire also 'forever'?    So I wanted to know if they were any significance to the presence of the word ' abadan ' in realtion to the believers and not the disbelievers? Is there some particular honour attached to the believers in this  ayaah  with the additional ' abadan '?"
AbuIlyaas,1. Is it permissible for a sister to travel and live in another city for college? Ex:you get accepted into a professional school out of your city.  2. Does a group of girls satisfy the mahram  requirement?
AbuIlyaas,"Shaykh, does the  khul'  count as a normal divorce in terms of the number that can occur before remarriage is not permitted (unless the sister first takes and separates from a new husband)?   Such that, if a couple had historically had one divorce then reconciled/remarried, followed by one  khul'  then reconciled/remarried, they would only be able to have one more divorce or  khul'  before it would be considered a major separation which would require the sister to marry a new husband before she could remarry her first husband?"
AbuIlyaas,"Actually, I'll just stick 'em up and let me know if they're not viewable then I'll do it when I get home."
AbuIlyaas,"al-salamu 'alaykum ,  Did any of the  mufasirin  comment on why in surah al-Kahf 18:39 the person was told that it would have been better if he had said &quot; Masha' Allah, La quwata illa billah !&quot; and not &quot;  La hawla  wa la quwata illa billah &quot;? I'm used to seeing that combination in various authentic  adhkar , such as when one leaves one's home, and the question often comes to mind when I read that  ayah ."
AbuIlyaas,"Yes, I should've mentioned that really."
AbuIlyaas,"Jazaakum Allaahu khairan ,   Would there be any online sites that anyone could recommend as cheap for getting software from? Or am I better going down Tottenham Court Road and have some smarmy salesman convince me into buying something more expensive than I need.    I hate going to PC World it's like they've been trained to walk away from you when want to ask a question. They tend to huddle and look down on people, &quot;hey, that guy with the beard wants to get something for his computer!&quot; Yes, and it might also surprise you to know that I didn't travel to your shop on a horse and cart either!   Also, the best online place to get cheap printer ink? I've got a Canon Pixma MP130 (I think, I forgot to write it down before I left the house and it looks like  this one , so maybe?)"
AbuIlyaas,Watching that I wondered if the Kung Fu Master had learnt his wax-on/wax-off technique from Mr. Miyagi.  I also didn't realise we could upload video if we disguised it as zip files.
AbuIlyaas,"My bed side alarm clock has a &quot;stop watch&quot; function. Now, what in the world is that all about? Did the manufacturers think that we'd all suddenly start wanting to time ourselves whilst we sleep, or that competitive sleep would be introduced as an Olympic sport. It's beyond me why anyone thought to add this, what's next an bedside alarm clock that's water resistant up to 100m?"
AbuIlyaas,"al-Salamu 'alaykum AbuAhmad,  Jazaka Allahu khayran for raising your complaint. Please also be aware that we have a &quot;report bad post&quot; function (on the left, below the poster's username) which allows anyone to raise an objection about a`particular post. Any message that you send via this function is automatically emailed to all the moderators.  We do, as moderators, sometimes miss posts that have been made, often due to our various commitments or the sheer volume of material that is posted daily. The report bad post function allows others to help bring concerns to our attention.  As far as the topic being a general one, and not one directly related to Islam, then the Corner Table section of this board allows for such and so whilst seeking holiday advice might not be to everyone's taste it is not in and of itself eligible for deletion.  Baraka Allahu fikum."
AbuIlyaas,"'Eed Mubarak, kulla 'am wa antum bi khayr!!!!!!!       (witness2dTRUTH i miss you   )"
AbuIlyaas,"I still can't access the site, it's been down around seven hours that I've noticed."
AbuIlyaas,"King David will you kindly stop swamping the boards with excessive cutting and pasting? If you want to link to a book please do so through a URL rather than bombarding the board with excessive text that you haven't written yourself. Your posting behaviour is very similar to that of spammer.  I've deleted the most recent spree, feel free to repost it by  linking to it only .  And yes, it's a very old book that you're referencing and the refutations of it have been circulated many years ago and it doesn't hold any sway with the people but you've obviously just come across it and feel that it complements your &quot;new&quot; religion that you're in the process of forming."
AbuIlyaas,Some of the headaches can be tea and coffee withdrawl related. It's perhaps an idea to get out of the cycle of them pre-Ramadan so that your body isn't expecting it's regular 'something o'clock' tea break.

AbuIlyaas,"al-salamu 'alaykum Shaykh,  I was given this definition for the practice of  wazifah .    Quote:    The Arabic word waz頵a literally means assignment, duty or daily ration and is commonly used to describe a Sufi practice of focusing the attention, by means of recitation or meditation, on a particular Divine Quality in order to allow that quality to be expressed more openly and more powerfully in one's day-to-day life.  The goal of waz頵a practice is to develop an intimate connection to these Divine Qualities and allow the Qualities to be reflected openly and freely in our lives.  A common waz頵a practice is, for example, to use the Beautiful Names as part of a daily spiritual practice by choosing a couple of the Divine Qualities which seem to be lacking or out of balance in one's life, and reciting each of the chosen qualities, such as y?lat頵, y?b鈚in, 33 or 99 times as an invocation, while deeply and powerfully imagining and feeling the successful expression of those Divine Qualities in one's own life experience."
AbuIlyaas,"Quote:     Originally Posted by  Khadijah~UmmZakariyyah   if she is dovirced she can give herself away in marriage.     Just in case you were unaware, what you stated is the position of the Hanafi ` ulamaa '. The majority position is, however, that she still requires a  walee  to remarry, based on the  hadeeth.  &quot;There is no marriage except with a  walee .&quot; (Ahmad, Abu Dawud, al-Nasai and others)  Here's a bit from Islam q-a:     Quote:     It is not permissible for a man to marry a woman without the permission of her guardian, whether she is a virgin or previously-married. This is the view of the majority of scholars, including al-Shaafa抜, Maalik and Ahmad. This is based on evidence which includes the following:         The verses in which Allaah says      (interpretation of the meaning):            揹o not prevent them from marrying their      (former) husbands?           [al-Baqarah 2:232]             揂nd do not marry Al-Mushrikaat      (idolatresses) till they believe (worship Allaah Alone)?           [al-Baqarah 2:221]             揳nd marry those among you who are single?           [al-Noor 24:32]           The point here is that these verses clearly stipulate that there be a guardian in marriage, because Allaah is addressing the guardian with regard to the marriage of the woman under his care. If the matter were up to her and not him, there would be no need to address him.     from  http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=en...&amp;QR=7989&amp;dgn=4           There is also a lot on the marriage contract (including the status of the  walee ) on this site.  http://www.java-man.com/Pages/Marriage/Marriage05.html"

AbuIlyaas,"al-Salamu 'alaykum ,  I believe that this is a good  da'wah  lecture to give someone you're telling about Islam.   It was given by Dr. Abu Ameenah Bilal Philips to the Swindon Philosophical society. He basically runs through the hadith of Jibril (i.e. What is Islam, Iman &amp; Ihsan). There's an interesting Q&amp;A session afterwards. It's also has a relatively good quality recording level and so it shouldn't put people off because of too much hiss.  I'm sending it two ways. Firstly, here's the entire lecture and Q&amp;A as one complete audio track, lasting around 1h50mins.   http://www.yousendit.com/transfer.ph...3ECC320810157D   Then I've split the same thing into two:  The main lecture,   http://www.yousendit.com/transfer.ph...11A96A24DE9881   and the Q&amp;A session.   http://www.yousendit.com/transfer.ph...827DDC50461030"

AbuIlyaas,There is a prohibition on striking to the face in Islam but mixed martial arts involves more than just striking to the face. So even if you exclude that from your repertoire there is still plenty left to practice.

AbuIlyaas,"Quote:     Originally Posted by  UmmAbdulMalikStorm   If ur gay u obviously think homosexuality is permissable..So no u cant be a gay muslim. Dont be so technical.     The point that Prof was making is correct, whilst homosexuality is clearly a major sin it is not  kufr akbar . It is theoretically possible for someone to be committing a major sin without believing that it is lawful, even feeling ashamed of it, and not therefore being a kafir.   It is not a given that someone who sins believes that it is lawful. We do not, for instance, make  takfir  on any drunk Muslim we spot stumbling out of a pub on the basis that he is so brazen in his sinfulness he must also hold that it is lawful.  Shaykh Isam also made this point about homosexuality in our &quot;Ask the Scholar&quot; section  here .  However, the problem with many of those on the TV last night was that, in addition to their foul behaviour, they were performing linguistic somersaults trying to convince the world that their behaviour was lawful in Islam."
AbuIlyaas,"I haven't tried contacts yet, I'm still trying to get used to the world of spectacles, as I've only recently had to start wearing them.  Regarding manliness etc. I was surprised to see that Karo Parisyan wore contacts in his mixed-martial arts fight against Nick Diaz. I would have thought that would have been dangerous to wear 'em when someone was fighting. The guy even got one knocked out of his eye during the fight, and he still won - props! That was an area of concern for me if you wore them and some trouble kicked off such as at work etc. But glasses are just as irritating in that scenario, as you either have to allow time to take them off, or risk having to buy a new pair afterwards."
AbuIlyaas,"Thanks for explaining.   I had a friend at university who had some recordings of prank calls that he and his friends had made, they used to gather around a speaker phone when they made them so that they could all laugh.    One of his friends was particularly nasty in the calls he made and it actually made the regional news in his area but he got his comeuppance one day.    In the middle of a prank call, the women on the other end stopped him and asked him:   Have you ever been to the doctors about your voice? What? Because you sound just like my father did and he died of throat cancer [Then she hung up on him].   My friend told me that his friend was left holding the receiver speechless."
AbuIlyaas,"How's about we all (me too) work towards a bit of overlooking each others' mistakes, especially seeing as it's Ramadan.   Also, from Abu Dawud:            Quote:      Book 41, Number 4782:   Narrated AbuUmamah:   The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: I guarantee a house in the surroundings of Paradise for a man who avoids quarrelling even if he were in the right, a house in the middle of Paradise for a man who avoids lying even if he were joking, and a house in the upper part of Paradise for a man who made his character good."

AbuIlyaas,"A tan is a bronzing or darkening of the skin through prolonged exposure to sunlight, it can be replicated by using ultra violet rays on a sun-bed. To be tanned is often perceived as a means of beautification and light skin people, such as Europeans, often spend considerable time working on a tan during the summer months.   A fake tan is a cosmetic alternative, it is non-permanent dye applied to the exterior of the skin to replicate the colouring that prolonged exposure to the sun gives skin. As with things like henna the colouration that it gives to skin will disappear in time."

Will one day's Salat (prayer) suffice for the Salat of that day which will be equal to one year?'' Thereupon he said, &quot;  No, but you must make an estimate of time and then offer Salat  .''"

Ok, I've asked my Mum about the &quot;... cant bring the children up as muslims ...&quot; bit. She found it very strange that someone would be told that.    The birth parents can put a stipulation that a child will be raised in a particular religion, which the local authority would honour by making that conditional upon the future foster/adopted parents. For example, a mother gives up her child for adoption because she was raped by an in-law, but asks that the child be raised as a Catholic because she was.   But this would still be child specific. There would be other children who did not come with this condition or even children who came with the condition that they be raised as Muslim.   My Mum insists that there is a large emphasis on matching children to families with similar cultural backgrounds to that which they've come from. There are lots of children up for adoption who've come from Muslim backgrounds, so I don't see why an authority/agency would be restrictive in giving a child to a family with an Islamic background.   I'm not saying this about you're friend specifically but an adoption application can be blocked for other reasons. Adoption agencies are thorough when checking families out. The family will undergo numerous checks, criminal history, financial checks, marital stability, etc. It can be an extended process as a family is vetted and a potential child is matched, but I'm sure we can all appreciate, that for the child's benefit, it is important that checks like this are carried out."
AbuIlyaas,But I like the resources box idea
AbuIlyaas,"Sister, it is very difficult to learn  tajwid  through written question and answers and some of the terms that Shaykh Isam mentioned in his answer might themselves need explaining.  Tajwid  really needs to be directly learned from a teacher and in person.   It was astute of you to notice the difference in pronunciation whilst listening to that particular recitation. The institute that I studied with used  this book and audio cassette  as a course text when we covered  tajwid . It may give you some insight into some of the rules but it is no substitute for learning from a teacher.    Perhaps if you started a thread in another section of the board someone else could point to an online resource that explains some of the rules alongside audio examples, insha' Allah."

AbuIlyaas,"Here's an article that Jamal Zarabozo published in the magazine al-Basheer, 1989. In it he addresses the issue of the criticism of the  ahaadeeth  in Bukhari and Muslim.    It's scanned wonky but the version I had was also wonky."
AbuIlyaas,Is there not some kind of legal restriction for children on discussion forums in general? I remember Abu Hurayrah saying something once on al-maghrib about 13 year old (or it could've been younger) needing parental consent or not being allowed. It was in a thread that got deleted and it was mentioned in the context of admonition to some users who'd been acting childishly.
AbuIlyaas,Here's the last bit.

It's a pretty warped thing to do to dress like a woman just to see one.

I've got someone coming over soon but it is before the release date, so I had to settle for ordering a Pride DVD and a BJJ instructional instead.  If I lose patience I might just have a look for it on YouTube, I assume that is where you got your copy from, right?

AbuIlyaas,"al-salamu 'alaykum,  These last months there's been an influx of spam to my IN address, they seem to be targeting a mailing list primarily sent to someone's account abuabdullah[at]islamicnetwork.com and my address must be added in their somewhere.  How come? I even get some spam to an IN address that I never use (but outlook still gathers mail from) ands no-one knows that address at all. I could sort of understood my AbuIlyaas one getting targeted with spam because it'll be posted somewhere on the site and the spider bots will likely have found it. But this other address no-one should know.   So have the spammers got a list of every account IN have or do they just use some program that sends spam to every alphabetically possible combination at IN mail?"

In Kamali's book he says that in  Zaad al-Ma'aad (2/419),  Ibn al-Qayyim spoke about apostacy in early Islam and said that the death pentalty for it was a purely political issue because the apostate threatened the foundations of Islam and its political organisation.   He then said that even though blasphemy today can certainly be dangerous and threaten the law and order of a society (eg Salman Rushdie), it cannot threaten the existence or continuity of Islam &quot;as a great religion, a legal system, and a major civilisation,&quot; so Kamali's conclusion is that capital punishment for apostacy was authorised by the Sunnah for those reasons at that time, and these circumstances no longer exist today.    So yes, bizarre as it is, you heard right.     I was actually kind of hoping that you'd say, &quot;no, you completely misunderstood what he said, he meant...&quot;   From reading his book he a takes a particular stance towards  hadeeth ahaad  as being  zhannee  evidence, and there are numerous references to him giving preference to things like  qiyaas  over them. So I'd have to assume that the  hadeeth  in Bukhaaree that al-Munajjid quoted above is  ahaad  and Kamali sees there as being some leeway to interpret it in a wider context of general Qur'aanic injunctions.   I personally, dislike this opinion and will store it in a similar place to where I am currently storing  Zaki Badawi's recent words ."

AbuIlyaas,"How did you manage to save that much by the age of 10/11?  I used to be given ? dinner money each day for school. I'd buy 1/2 pound of Tiny Tots (like Jelly Babies) and eat them on the bus before I got to school. By around playtime I'd stopped feeling ill. Then by lunch time I'd use the left over money to buy a couple of plain bread rolls to stop my stomach rumbling until I got home.   Saving money just never came into the equation, apart from when I didn't buy Tiny Tots for a couple of weeks so that I could buy some new skateboard wheels (OJ II's, black, 95A  , but the Old Skool Rat Bones I got later were better)."

This instructs doctors that it is their wish to not be r  esuscitated   if their heart stops.   2) What should a Muslim doctor do if they find themselves operating on a person who has made a DNR declaration, should they honour it and not r  esuscitate   them if their heart stops?"

AbuIlyaas,"wa iyaki   Yeah, I like him as a speaker based on what I heard but I haven't found much in circulation by him since 2000. I understand that he's the Imam at the Islamic Center of Boulder, Colorado Springs. I think Boulder is/was where Jamal Zarabozo was based too. ( This  is 'Ammar)  When he gave the lecture series on Iman in London he also gave a lecture discussing part of the  ayah  in al-Baqarah  &quot;... but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them&quot;  (2:228), which I wanted to hear but the sound was corrupted on the recording and the cassette is incoherent.  There's another talk by him that I've commonly seen on a number of sites called &quot;Revival of the Islamic Character and Ethics&quot; (e.g. on Islam.com  here ) but I haven't gotten around to listening to it yet."
AbuIlyaas,Abu Ammar Yasir Qadhi discussed some of the issues in brief in  this post  on al-maghrib.
AbuIlyaas,"Hey, I didn't realise but that site hosts a lot of fight clips. I was a bit gutted at the outcome of Couture/Liddel part 3 but I was intending waiting for the official DVD release so I should be grateful I found out long before that.

AbuIlyaas,"I was familiar with the word but not the following shade of meaning:    Prone   adj.  lying flat or face downwards.   I was reading my station log book at work and someone had written &quot; noticed a prone man on platfo rm.&quot; And I was scratching my head thinking, &quot;A prone man? Prone? What was he inclined or predisposed to do - be male?&quot;   I also occasionally get a laugh at some of the mistakes people make in our log book, like this entry I once read, &quot; So-and-so manager on station to deliver massage .&quot;"
AbuIlyaas,"I have noticed something alarming and have posted my investigations here as a pdf (as this site would not let me use the font I wanted, which is suspicious in itself)."
AbuIlyaas,"Oh wait! Do you think I was arguing, like some ` ulama ' did, that the word  khamr  is restricted in meaning to 'wine' only? Because I wasn't. &quot;Every intoxicating substance is unlawful.&quot; (al-Bukhari)  I was just supporting the opinion that the  hadith  &quot;Whatever intoxicates in large quantities, then a small quantity of it is forbidden&quot; (al-Tirmidhi, Abu Dawud, and others) is understood by looking at the substance as a whole, rather than the parts it is made up of. For example, in asking does Pepsi intoxicate? We'd look at drinking Pepsi as a whole liquid rather than saying this 0.0001% ingredient that they use, if isolated, concentrated, and consumed would intoxicate.  Am I making myself understood here or just rambling?  It's like Salman al-`Oadah surmised &quot;The percentage of alcohol mentioned has no effect on the ruling. The ruling applies to the drink itself taken as a whole and not to its composition.&quot;"

They'll likely ask why and then I say because I've seen a better offer elsewhere, which they'll invariably try to match or beat.    But I need that 'better offer' to tell them about over the phone.   I've got 12 month contract, ?0 a month, with 200 anytime/anybody minutes and 50 texts a month.

AbuIlyaas,"Quote:        Careful With Words                    Written by: Hamzah Moin          The tongue is something that we have to guard very carefully.    ...            I had initially wanted to raise an objection to this article and point out the presence of bad slang within the article itself. As it is only the third sentence before the word 'sucks' comes into play and how ironic I thought it to conclude an objection to bad slang with the phrase, &quot;the latter sucks.&quot;  The objection I thought to raise was based upon the argument that a sister once presented  here .  However, I'm rapidly coming to the conclusion that this phrase has passed into idiom and is now far removed from its unsavoury origin. So that now it is no more than ...      suck                     Verb.  To be worthless, contemptible or disgusting. E.g.&quot;The storyline in that book is a little contrived and the characters suck.&quot;            Noun.  Sweets, confectionary in general. A  suck shop  being            a sweet shop. [W. Midlands use]    [source:   http://www.peevish.co.uk/slang/s.htm  ]     Even the Oxford English Dictionary lists a similar meaning for it amongst the many that it gives to the word.   And indeed, the origin of the word used in derision, as argued by this author  here , seems from England rather than N.America and more innocent than was previously suggested.   Plus, as I read more about  usool, I seem more inclined to feel that the expression 'sucks' has indeed achieved an  'urf qawli  whereby its application is sufficiently far enough removed from any inappropriateness.      Allaahu A'lam , different opinions are welcome.    And with this, I can now feel more at ease quoting a phrase that Bart Simpson engraved in my mind, and one which I found myself using in summary of the re-election of George W. Bush.     &quot;I didn't think that this was possible but this both sucks and blows at the same time.&quot;"

AbuIlyaas,I don't know exactly how but I managed to crack the screen (internally) of my two month old laptop.  Now I've got this big black bruise thing staring at me all day long.

AbuIlyaas,"Another thing that I'm curious about is: was the adjective &quot;misguided&quot; in the title specifically there because IN Staff differed from the fiqhi stance that our brother Qaasim advocates?  Or, was it a case of giving a specific advice and our brother thought to include a general pronouncement upon a number of specific individuals whilst he was giving it; i.e. our misguidance would still be present even if we were to capitulate and follow his fiqhi position?  Because if it were the former, that a person differing from another in an area of fiqh is to be deemed as &quot;misguided&quot;; then I must pass the comment that I haven't heard such a principle advocated before. You differ in your fiqh and hence are to be labelled as misguided.   Which leads me to another question: Historically would all those who differed with others in fiqh, but did not feel the need to attribute misguidance to them, also be considered as misguided because they differed by not implementing this principle?"

AbuIlyaas,"I'm struggling to understand this.  Please check my understanding so far.  You have a product which you are trying to get an &quot;official&quot; halal certification for. I didn't notice where you elaborated on what the product was but I'm assuming that it's food based and that is why you're seeking certification.  You're attempting to get this certficate by texting people including a Kentucky Imam.  You're documenting your attempts at getting the certificate on a blog somewhere. I'm kind of confused where I'm supposed ton reading twitters or IslamCrunch, as they seem to keep linking back to one another.  Is that correct?  I also don't understand what you're saying about twitter mania but am happy there's an 'i' in the name and not an 'a'.  Please could you dumb all of this down for me because it seems way beyond my current ability to understand? Thanks."

If you want to help the Palestinian people in particular, you might find it easier to offer your services to one of the charities working in the numerous refugee camps in the surrounding countries like Lebanon or Jordan.

A lot of energy is being devoted to &quot;he/she said&quot; type circular arguments. I really believe that this is a distraction from Shaytan ( la'natu Allahu 'alayh ). We have important issues that have been raised and I see absolutely no reason why we can't stick to these topics and leave off the repeated defense/attack of one another.  Look, in all honesty a lot has been said previously, it's true and if we continue to sift through past posts and drag up statements here and there we'll never seise discussing what has been said. We need to move on and overlook any statements that we found personally hurting seeking the pleasure of Allah and concentrate on where the truth lies in the actual issues that have been raised.  We are discussing each other when the Qur'an and Sunnah has more right to be discussed.  Can we please try to return to what are the differences in the subject matter and not in the personalities? With that in mind I'd like to delete some posts here to help acheive this goal."

The pre-marital interaction is something that has restrictions on it and if it was executed correctly, I find it difficult to conceive that the above theory could be actualised, especially the bit about love blinding the woman. That is precisely the need for the   walee  . His consent is required in marriage or it is not in fact marriage. I doubt that this hypothetical male would likewise be able to mesmerise her   walee  .     Regarding the concealment of the disabilities, then marriage is like any other contract, in that these details are going to have to be made known to the other party before they agree. Deception should not play a part in an Islamic contract. If a party in sale, for instance, discovered a defect in the goods that he'd bought and it could be established that the seller had hidden this information, they would have the option to annul the contract or seek compensation for the defect and then agree to keep the goods 'as is'.

AbuIlyaas,"al-Salamu 'alaykum ,   Has anyone any experience of implementing the hadith &quot;  Order your children to pray at the age of seven. And beat them [lightly] if they do not do so by the age of ten. And separate them in their bedding .&quot; (Abu Dawud)  in the West ?    It's not time yet but I'm feeling a little apprehensive about when it does come. Waking my seven year old up at about 3 - 4 a.m. (in the summer months) for  fajr , then again at 7 a.m. to get up for school, plus trying to keep them awake to the other end of the day to make  'isha  at 11 p.m.   Even myself I sometimes find the summer months, where there's around 4 hours between  'isha  and  fajr , strenuous especially when combined with the shift work pattern that I work, but it's  salah  so you just do it irrespective of how tired you are.   Thinking ahead I'm just a little worried about the impact on the 7-10 year olds. Such as tiredness at school, the tantrums when you keep waking them up, and the fear that the lack of sleep will make them averse to the  salah  itself. I had a friend who once said that when they're that age, he'll just let them sleep through  fajr  till they wake up for school and make them pray then. But from a  fiqhi  perspective I just can't justify such an action.   Ideally I'd like to change country to somewhere where the  salah  times don't fluctuate so wildly over the year, but practically I doubt I'll be able achieve such a goal.   So has anyone any practical experience of teaching their kids to pray and how did you cope with  fajr  and  'isha  during the summer months?"

Whereas a man will concentrate on one task only, e.g. ensuirng that he uses every utensil he can find in the kitchen; then expecting praise for his accomplishment for at least a week and a half.

AbuIlyaas,Is there an link (beyond old wives' tales) between eating sweets and coughing?  I've heard it said that chocolate biscuits and orange juice (cordial) can make you cough a bit.  I have a cold at the moment and my order of  Damla chews  arrived of which I dutifully scoffed a significant amount. My cough happened (in my opinion) to get worse and I was told &amp;quot;it's because of all them sweets you ate.&amp;quot;  Ideally I'd like to be able to tell this person this is erroneous and just a conspiracy to reduce my sweet intake.   Anyone got any information?

AbuIlyaas,"I just posted this on Upon Sunnah and I don't know how long the link will last as it's a yousendit one.  Shaykh Ali al-Timimi famously gave a lecture called &quot;Advice to the Salafis of the UK&quot;, after which he was condemned by some as teaching that tawheed is of four categories.  He came back to the UK soon after giving the lecture and this accusation was put to him in a question after a lecture he gave (along with Ammar Amonette) called &quot;The Means of Change - The Dawn of a New Era.&quot;  This is where he made his clarification about his stance on tawheed and responded to some of the critique.  It's about 15 mins long and I believe it was given at one of the QMW University's annual dinners.  I tried to reduce the hiss but it just seemed to sound worse (like he was speaking inside a tin can) and so I left it as is.   http://s65.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=2...C2NLXM7KZFE32T"

The article says that this drug was prohibited over there.   http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/s...es/4538523.stm   Does anyone know the background to this prohibition? Is there a fatwa prohibiting either of these drugs or is it a 'state issue'?   I am aware that Temazepam is a drug that has been abused amongst club-goers but it had never occured to me that it may be prohibited in the  sharee'ah . As it is primarily (to my knowledge) prescribed for sleep disorders.  Anyone with info?

CCTV footage isn't as amazing as people think. It's not live footage like you see when you watch something like CSI. You get still shots taken from each camera at around every 2 - 3 seconds, sometimes a lot more.   A lot of movement can take place in between shots, so events when they are played back are often difficult to discern. I once played back the footage of when this school girl kicked me in the leg and tried to pull my beard. There was only one still of the incident and it looked more like we were dancing than anything else.  In all honesty the still shot that all these conspiracies are about (outside Luton) is about the quality that you'd normally expect."

AbuIlyaas,"I feel there is a difference between reading a book and studying from one. The latter requires more effort and yields deeper understanding and retention. Where you have to answer questions on a topic, rephrase something in your own words, or sift through looking for quotes; it all facilitates transfer of the knowledge from the pages to the long term memory.  So if I have a book which I am studying then I may well write notes in it, underline text or asterisk points. All of this helps me digest the topic, I don't feel it is disrespectful to the knowledge. Disrespecting a book in my eyes is buying it and sticking it on your shelf without ever reading it.  My four year old son seems to have embarked upon the path of making notes in books, I found this in my dictionary when I opened it. I'm not sure what he's trying to tell me about feta cheese, that's the trouble when someone writes in short-hand!"

AbuIlyaas,"al-salamu 'alaykum,  I think that it is good idea to restrict it in that direction anyway because you run less risk that way of hosting inappropriate pictures, music and the like (I say less, being fully aware that some Muslims fall into it).  Plus I don't think it's a big deal when there are many other blogging services out there for everyone to use. Maybe if the market was restricted then make it a more &quot;open&quot; invitation but with things so widely available you have no need to.   It's like halal chocolate bars, does the presence of this Muslim word &quot;halal&quot; put non-Muslims off buying it, to be blunt, who cares? They can eat it if they want to, thoughts like that shouldn't stop us from fulfiling a need in our own community.   We don't have a blogging service, so why not create one?"
AbuIlyaas,"I asked  Abu Eesa Niamatullah  about it and he said:     Quote:    2.

Why not try and make some money with it? And anyway as the other brother has mentioned, HSBC can't take it anyway.  Personally, I have given my voucher to The Children's Mutual Shariah Fund  http://www.thechildrensmutual.co.uk/default.aspx?page=394  which I have checked out insha'Allah and I am happy with their details, workings and investments. That's what I recommend all readers to do and Allah knows best    I also sent my voucher to the above link. The thing is you have to take some action because if you don't act they will automatically invest it without your consent. So, wa Allahu a'lam, but I think it is better to take the step and select the Shari'ah Fund option before they put your child's voucher into something that Muslims should avoid."
AbuIlyaas,"Subhaana Allaah , I think some of the men in Saudi shouldn't be allowed to drive as well. I couldn't believe the way people drive over there. There seems to be two speeds, (i) stop, and (ii) as fast as you can go. I was only there ten days and I must have seen four accidents. I saw one youth on a bike and someone knocked him clean off it, the driver asked if he was allright and was just like &quot;ma feehi mushkil&quot; and cycled off.   Someone nearly knocked our 'umrah guide over, I can still picture him in the middle of the road waving his fist and shouting &quot;from the donkey to the car&quot; about the driver and his ancestors.   My non-Muslim parents were very anxious about me going, as it was around the time of a number of bombings. When I phoned home and they sought reassurance that I was alright, I explained that the biggest threat to my life was crossing the road from the bin Dawood store to the local call centre."

I also work with trains; graffiti and trains have a long history together.    My complaint is that a graffiti artist used to gain fame through the quality of their work but in more recent years many youth prefer just to gain notoriety by how prolifically they can write their tag (signature) everywhere. Rather than create anything worth looking at.   This developed into people using nails/screws etc. to scratch their name onto glass as it had a greater permanencey than spray painting. It costs a lot more to replace a train window than it does to repaint a carriage.    An even more extreme form, that I saw photos of, is where they use gloves to burn their name onto surfaces using acid and a sponge.   Tox was a notorious vandal in London whose tags Toxic and Tox 01 - 04 regularly appeared on trains and buildings. He was arrested (again) last year, and his reign ended with TOX 04. Elament was/is another 'famous' one who liked scratching on train windows.   I just mentioned them because I figured any Londoners here would have seen their nonsense whilst travelling.

AbuIlyaas,"The issue is not one of confusion for the Muslims.  Jews and Christians who do not die upon Islam are destined for the Hell fire.    Quote:    &quot; Indeed, they who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the polytheists will be in the fire of Hell, abiding eternally therein. Those are the worst of creatures.&quot;  (Surah al-Bayinah 98:6)      Quote:    It is narrated on the authority of Abu Hurayrah that the Messenger of Allah ( salla Allahu 'alayhi wa sallam ) observed: By Him in Whose hand is the life of Muhammad, he who amongst the community of Jews or Christians hears about me, but does not affirm his belief in that with which I have been sent and dies in this state (of disbelief), he shall be but one of the denizens of Hell-Fire. ( Sahih Muslim )    And when we look to definitions of what &quot;Islam&quot; is, we do not have recourse to semantic acrobatics such as has preceded here, the definition was given to us very concisely by the Messenger of Allah (salla Allahu 'alayhi wa sallam) himself in the famous hadith of Jibril ( 'alayhi al-Salam ):    Quote:    ... 慚uhammad, tell me about Islam.?The Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless with him and grant him peace, said, 慖slam is that you witness that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and you establish the prayer, and you give the Zakat, and you fast Ramadan, and you perform the hajj of the House if you are able to take a way to it.?.."

Royce was like 26 when he first fought in the UFC so he'll be around 40 now. Randy was a fluke in terms of fighting at that age, Royce is way past competing with elite. Even his fights in Pride have been against opponents that weren't amazing. I'm actually shocked Royce agreed to fight Matt. The old school Gracies tend to avoid fighting people actually familiar with MMA and target people specialising in one discipline.  Akhi, I don't know if you've seen enough of Matt Hughes's fights if you think his style is boring. He manages a wrestling slam in nearly every fight, which always makes the highlight reel. Plus he's from the Miletich camp and is extremely well rounded. He pulled a simply awesome arm bar on St Pierre (I think, if not then it was against Verissimo), it was just perfect in its execution.  Matt Hughes is definately an all time favourite of mine. The Royce fight will be exciting to watch because of who he is (i.e. The original UFC champion) but I'm not expecting anything short of a Matt Hughes victory. The game has changed a lot since Royce was on top of the pile."

AbuIlyaas,"Someone pointed this out to me this morning and  masha ' Allah it looks like a successful and unique project.        Umma Community Clinic         Website   Documentary on You Tube :  I remember some years ago moving within London and due to shortage of GPs and the over subscription of patients in the new area, I found it extremely difficult to get a GP for myself and my family.  The only option given to me was the geographically closest practice which was an Christian Missionary medical practice opened in the area (I guess because there's a high Muslim population in the area; more souls to save, etc).   I checked it out and saw the various leaflets and posters that lined the practice's waiting rooms and thought there's no way I want me family going to clinic that openly professes it's status as being missionary.  I had to kick up a fuss on religious grounds of objection with the find-a-doc service through the NHS to be allowed to get on the books of a non-religious GP.  But at the time I thought to myself why aren't their any Islamic faith based projects similar to the Christian missionary one that I had to fight to stay away from.   Masha'  Allah, I can see that some brothers and sisters in the states have taken that initiative and I pray that similar projects open up in other countries and communities.   Jazahum Allahu khayran  to those involved."
AbuIlyaas,"Insha' Allah, I'll try and get the book. Lynne Truss also referred to it a number of times in her new book &quot; Talk to the hand .&quot; Which is an okay read, nothing special. I think she was under pressure to get a new book out to ride the success of her &quot; Eats, Shoots and Leaves .&quot; But it's a hard book to follow."
AbuIlyaas,"I think it's the program I use to join the pages that I scan together, some people can't seem to open it. When I get home I'll gather all the separate pages and post them in a zip file,  inshaa' Allaah!"
AbuIlyaas,"Shaykh Isam has answered many questions on the issue of travelling with/without mahrams. Here are some:   Living alone without a Mahram    Travelling w/o Mahram   Travelling without a mahram out of necessity   Women travelling without mahram   Sisters' camp without a mahram   Husband suggests I move to another country.   A female studying aboard without a mahram.   Does a women's mahram have to live in the same building as her when travelling?   Women travelling without mahrams to a wedding?    Without mahram, in groups of sisters...    Obeying Mother vs. Travelling without Mahram       And about travelling by car:   Women Travelling In A Car By Herself    Follow up on Q about women travelling.   And on the distance that constitutes travelling:   What distance must a person go to be considered a traveller?    Distance that makes a person a traveller.    By what distance is a person considered a traveller?   There are other answers as well but this should be enough to start you off, insha' Allah."
AbuIlyaas,"Akhi, did you come across these lectures based on the book?  Sister Shajaa3ah posted this previously:     Quote:     There is an explanation of his book by Abu Muhammad Abdur-Ra抲f Shakir (author of the book  The Islamic Ruling concerning Tasweer ) in a series of 20 audio lectures  here .  (There are also other beneficial series on the  same site )."
AbuIlyaas,"Yeah, that's the same one. It's really strange that they cite the sister as the translator, as the actual book doesn't mention a translator; and the various  du'aat  that have recommended it over other translations (of the meaning) have often referrred to this lack of disclosure, about the translator, as a shortcoming of the work.   I scanned 12 pages before I went to bed last night but didn't try uploading it from home as my dial-up connection of 50.6 kbps seems to take far too long upload.   So I'll try sticking the pages up here today whilst i'm at work. I just tried doing the twelve pages as fully connected document but this site's upload limit is 9.1 MB and my bit was over 11. So it'll a page by page thing.   But please could you tell me if this page I'm posting now (number two) is readable or not because when I upload from work I can't thereafter read it. So there is always an element of doubt in my head that no-one else can. So please give a confirmation for this one I'm doing now.   Also, if any page I post is not up to standard please point it out and I'll re-do it  in shaa' Allaah."

He asked if I was Muslim and I said that I was getting there and so he insisted on not taking any money.   Things like that still happen to me today.

AbuIlyaas,"I'd always meant to start a thread like this but I was going to add &quot;... and from what age?&quot;  When we (me and my bro) were young we were given ?.50 each week; but for this; we had to clean the whole house properly every Friday after school. Like moving furniture when hovering, dust everywhere, clean glass/mirrors, clean the bath and toilets, clean the kitchen and mop the floor. I realise many of you sisters will have done this for free whilst growing up.   So it kind of helped us not to be totally averse to cleaning and it also taught us the relationship between hard work and monetary reward.  Because the other &quot;normal&quot; way to teach a child about commitment and work is when they get their first paper round. But I'm not sure I'd be comfortable with a child of mine getting one, as there are some newspapers that will need deliverying that are better defined as pornography than journalism."

AbuIlyaas,"I think this is a  fiqhi  issue. Is the one suffering from mental health problems to be excluded from the  masjid ? This may have different implications depending on the gender of the person, owing to the obligation upon the male to attend the  jama'a ; along with which mental problem they have and the degree of it. It would be interesting to see what a  fiqh  council suggested in this case.  A couple of things occur to me about this topic. Living in the west, someone suffering from mental health problems is liable to be treated by  kaafir  doctors, etc., so there may be a harm to them if we exclude them from the community, as they could become insulated from any form of Islamic therapy or reminder.  I have seen a person recovering from a nervous breakdown in the  masjid  and within in a couple of seconds of talking to him you realised that some of the things he was saying, or the ways he was acting, were due to his illness and brothers just adjusted accordingly. The  masjid  was full of people being patient with him. There can be problems when someone like this meets someone with 'bad manners' (another  masjid  problem character), but on the whole his attendance seemed to be benefical to him.  Also, people with possession can have problems attending the  masjid  as it is, particularily if they are possessed by a  kaafir jinn . Making  salaah  may be very difficult for them as they fight the impulse to 'not pray'. Were the community to exclude them, then again it may harm the individual more than tolerating them would harm the community.  As for your  masjid  eccentric, I think his presence helps makes the rest of us look/feel more sane than we actually are.     Allaahu A'alim"

I've attached a cartoon strip about a Muslim at a Psychiatrist's. I think that the reaction to Psychiatric thought depicted in the cartoon is the natural reaction of anyone close to their  fitrah .      The concept mentioned is one developed by Sigmund Freud, one of the more sicker human beings to ever have walked on this planet. A man who was a strong advocate of cocaine usage (a position he later retracted) and a man who's advice to some patients who went to him complaining that they had been sexually abused as children, was to tell them that they were projecting repressed sexual desires onto others, i.e. they were making it up, whilst secretly wishing it were true.

One time I was travelling home from work and this Gori got on the tube train and announced herself as having been appointed to collect for  xyz  charity and that she had permission from London Underground to collect and would people please give generously.   Inaccuracies bug me so I walked over to her and pointed out that I know she doesn't have permission to collect on the tube. So she started arguing with me about how she does and she's got a letter, etc. I showed my ID and explained that under no circumstances does LUL allow anyone to collect on a train we only allow it on specified stations, in the ticket hall, and with written permission. She was still arguing so I told her to get off at the next station so that I could have escorted out of the station by staff.   Then all these people on the carriage start giving her money because I'm stopping her collecting. One guy as he puts money in her bucket looks at me and says &quot;You're the bad guy here, not her!&quot; I felt so small   .   In my mind if someone is prepared to get on a train and lie that they are collecting officially then they are also capable of lying about collecting for the charity at all. There's been many cases in the media of &quot;Charity Collectors&quot; living a life of luxury off their ill gotten gains.   So if your ever in London and someone gets on a tube to collect for a charity, by all means give if you want, but if they say they've got permission to do it then know that they're lying. Even if they flash a little plastic ID with their charity name on it, we absolutely do not let anyone collect on a train.   *Sad but true*"

AbuIlyaas,"al-salamu 'alaykum,  Can anyone suggest an alternative to Bonjela for a teething infant?

AbuIlyaas,"al-salamu 'alaykum,  This question popped into my head again today.  Did any of the  mufasirin   comment on why in surah al-Kahf 18:39 the person was told that it would have been better if they had he said &quot; Masha' Allah, La quwata illa billah! &quot; and not &quot;  La hawla   wa la quwata illa billah &quot;?

AbuIlyaas,"It might help if you cited where you read the statement so that we know the context within which it was made.

This principle can be incorrectly applied though, but just so that we understand within the levels of textual analysis ( al-dalalat ) we do have a principle where we derive opposite meanings."
AbuIlyaas,"al-salamu 'alaykum ,   Has anyone got any details of any fun family stuff to do over the spring school holidays?   I'm looking for something to entertain my kids with.

As in the narration that the Messenger ( Sallallahu 'alayhi wa sallam ) said &quot;Allah curses the one who performs  ta h lil,  and for whom it is performed.&quot; (Ahmad and al-Nisa'i, declared authentic by al-Albani in  Irwa' al-Ghalil )   Ta h lil  is where an agreement is made that someone (the  mu h ill  /  mu h allil ) will marry and sleep with the ex-wife and thereafter divorce her, allowing the first husband to remarry his ex-wife. And as the hadith mentions the various people in this contract are cursed.  However, if the ex-wife marries someone in a serious attempt at marriage and for whatever reason that new marriage breaks down the first husband may legally remarry his ex-wife. As in:   &quot;And if he has divorced her [for the third time], then she is not lawful to him afterward until [after] she marries a husband other than him. And if he [i.e., the second husband] divorces her, there is no blame upon them [i.e., the woman and her first husband] if they return to each other if they think that they can keep the limits of Allah. ...&quot;  (al-Baqarah 2:230)  As it is a report from a newspaper we can expect that they won't explain the issue correctly. I'm also assuming the reference to 100 days before remarriage is an approximation of the ' iddah  period for the woman."

Rickson Gracie - Choke   Alternatively there is more recent documentary on an American fighter, Mark Kerr, which follows him as his career peaks and then descends into steroid abuse. I found it really interesting as I'd seen most of the fights that it showed and didn't realise that all that stuff was going on in the background.   Mark Kerr - the Smashing Machine"

I was thinking of forwarding this to a friend to discuss it with him anyway, so I'll bounce off him to try and fine tune any question I want to put to the Dr. Kamali (actually, I think he's a professor isn't he?)   The position Kamali takes on particular  usool  issues is going to structure the way he approaches any topic.

Quote:     Originally Posted by  Kamali      Rahman then traces the chain of transmission of the  Hadith which proclaims 'kill whoever changes his religion' .

In his book on  hadeeth  does he make any statements on his position towards the  hadeeth  in Bukhari, for example does he say anything like there are weak  ahaadeeth  within it (albeit small in number)? (This is not a position I take although I have heard it voiced before)"
AbuIlyaas,"Akhi , the test would be: is it possible to become intoxicated by consuming product x?  If product x is wine then it is possible to consume enough of it to become intoxicated.  If product x is non-alcoholic beer (even with a very small percentage alcohol content) then the answer would be no (according to that article) as the stomach can only hold so much liquid. And the amount of liquid that would need to be drunk within a short enough time frame to intoxicate is inconsumable by a human.  I was just making you aware of the article which looks at the relevant  ahadith  and comes to that conclusion.

AbuIlyaas,"Well the thing is, I wanted to stay with  O2  because I can access my company's internal phone network directly, which I can't do with any other Mobile phone company. I just wasn't happy that all the CPW was offering me was the Nokia 6230i.   So when I phoned up and asked for my PAC number and said I'd seen something better with Vodaphone, as I was told they would, they started throwing all these offers at me to stay.   So it's the same contract as before, twelve months at ?0 per month, with 200 anytime minutes plus 50 texts.   Then the perks they offered were :   * The phone I wanted free, SonyEricson K750i, * Double minutes free (i.e. 400) and double texts (100) for first three months, * Half price line rental for first three months, * ?5 cash back (well they send a cheque) after the first three months elapses, * And a free blue tooth headseat worth ?0, I didn't ask which one as I'm not so fussed.   Orange did have good deals on at the moment like you said. They had the K750i for 200 anytime minutes + 500 texts a month at ?0. Vodaphone had the same but if you got it online it was ?5 a month. The Vodaphone deal was the one I cited on the phone to them as leverage to get what I wanted.   Like I said, I wanted to stay with them because of work (it's really handy being able to find out quickly what's up with the train service, even when I'm off duty and out'n'about), so it was just a matter of agreeing the terms. Plus my union has taken up the issue of the network coverage during the recent bombings, so  in shaa' Allaah  this may get resolved."

I'm not big on spreading lists of I.P. addresses like this, as it makes these idiots feel more important than they are.

Or, when I walk along a street and seeing an elderly Muslim man pass my  salaam . His jaw drops and he pulls the cigarette from his lip. A dumb founded look on his face which seems to cry out, &quot;Why are you talking to me, I don't know you?&quot;   Then there are those who have obviously encountered the above scenario before. Seeing me from a distance, and in an attempt to avoid the discomfort that this stranger- salaam  brings, suddenly finds something extremely interesting to look at on the other side of the road or on their shoes. They walk by with me conveniently edited out of their visual field.   But there are nice people out there too,  wa lillaah al-hamd !"
AbuIlyaas,"al-Salamu 'alaykum,  As you'll be aware the UK government signed in 2003 an agreement with the US whereby at their request UK citizens can be extradited to the United States for trial. It's a one-sided treated and there is no reciprocation whereby the UK can similarly request UK citizens.  A famous recent case in the media was of the  Enron Three . Amongst our community our brothers  Babar Ahmad  and  Syed Talha Ahsan  have both fallen foul of this treaty, more on their respective cases can be found on their sites.  A new website has been set up with a campaign strategy aimed at having this erroneous piece of legislation overturned.  You can read more about it and the campaign on the new site:   http://www.notoextradition.co.uk/"
AbuIlyaas,"That's what I thought about the string. However, I found this on a  Sikh website  about halal meat.

But if meat is to be taken at all, Guru Gobind Singh enjoined on the Khalsa Panth not to take kosher meat ie. Halal meat slaughtered and prepared for eating according to the Islamic practice. In fact it is one of the kurahits for every amritdhari Sikh.  One who infringes it becomes patit (apostate).      Subhana Allah, they become murtad for eating halal meat!"

Again, there is benefit in a lot of martial arts, I just (personally) dislike it when there is too much emphasis on rehearsing on a submissive partner and little live sparring with someone actively resisting. San Shou does however have an annual competition with their Muay Thai counterparts, which I can appreciate.  I think I was a little put off Wing Chun when I saw David Levicki (a Wing Chun expert) get badly beaten by Rickson Gracie in the 1994 Vale Tudo Japanese Open (he didn't do much better in UFC either).  I haven't really noticed any Wing Chun fighters doing well in MMA competitions (anyone think of one?). I tend to refer to MMA fight history as a litmus test, as it pitches varying disciplines against one another in little or no rule competitions. Sort of lets the styles do the talking, rather than theorising what's better. I'm not dismissing Wing Chun I'm just mentioning that it's not known (someone can correct me if they want) to have excelled against other arts in these type of competitions. However, I'm sure that there are  many  Wing Chun students out there that could kick my  a** .  There was a very famous fight in UFC2 where a Kung Fu practioner Jason Delucia was pitched against Royce Gracie (Rickon's brother) a BJJ fighter. Royce popped Jason's arm, made the elbow bend the other way. Without downloading this myself first (as I need to sleep) I think it's either  this  or  this one , if not then I have it on VHS which I could lend out (after I get it back from someone). It's actually one of the more interesting UFC's from a comparative discipline approach, as it's before they introduced a lot of rules and most of the fighters are still naive to each others' styles.

Then I emailed them saying that I  very  much wanted to buy a copy and &quot;Can we work something out?&quot; - but they never replied.   I asked a friend who works in a bookshop about it and showed him the picture of the cover. He was fairly confident that they have had it in stock at some point, so I left my email address and told him to let me know if he can get it back in (about a month has passed and no email). To be honest, the cover looks similar to other books that I've seen and so I wasn't too hopeful when he said he'd seen it before.  So in summary, all I'm hearing/seeing is rumours that it exists without any physical evidence.  Did I mention that I would like to buy it?"

I had a good sift around the admin panel this morning and I think I've increased the editable time limit to 2 hours, during which you're free to edit/delete your posts.  However, we've had continuity problems in the past when excessive editing has left threads looking confused and disjointed. So please can everyone use the function wisely?   And also, as Muslims, we should remind ourselves that there's no edit/delete function in terms of what the angels record from us.

AbuIlyaas,The question about television can be found in this thread:   http://talk.islamicnetwork.com/showt...ght=television
AbuIlyaas,"I've slept with ear plugs for the last eight years, I can't sleep without them now.   When I first moved to London my first flat was directly above a shop that manufactured window frames. So every morning at eight they'd turn the radio on full blast and start with the band saw and hammer. The  only  day of the year they didn't work was Christmas day and the weird thing was I think they were Sikhs.   I have a constantly changing shift pattern at work, which combined with taking children to and from school and the constant change of the  salaah  times during the year, it means that a day's sleep is normally divided into 2, 3 or sometimes 4 bits. You basically end up getting so knackered you take what you get whenever it's going. So I might get a 2 hour, 3 hour and then another 1.5 hour block in a day at various times.   So my advice is: (i) ear plugs; (ii) just force yourself to the minimum sleep for the first few days and then by the third or fourth day you end up so tired you take whatever sleep is going."

AbuIlyaas,"Quote:     Originally Posted by  talibatun ul ilm   2) the way the imam does witr is a bit funny (ie, 3 rakat in one go with the tashahud in the second rakat, and a small silent qunoot) which as far as i can remeber from a ramadhan thread from last yr on RI said that u cant pray behind an imam who does this, so this yr i have avioded the witr in jammah. but then others have asked that should i not just join in with the jammah coz thats wot ur meant to do when u go to the masjid. so im a bit confused...which way is best??     Sister, did you come across  Islam-QA's answer  on this topic yet? I found it a thorough and just look at the subject.    And despite being clear that this is an issue upon which he disagrees with the  ahnaaf  he makes the beautiful point:     Quote:    There is nothing wrong with praying behind them, even if they pray in the manner that you have described, because what they are doing is following a mujtahid imam, so there is no justification for refusing to pray behind them or causing division amongst them, especially since you are living in a kaafir land and whatever troubles arise among you will reflect badly on Islam.    Other than that the other solution that I've heard to this issue is to pray the  witr  with them but not to make the  tasleem  with them. Instead stand up and make a fourth  raka'h  so that you have not made your  witr  like  maghrib,  you've made a four  raka'at nafl  prayer instead. You are then free to pray  witr  later at your leisure and it shouldn't cause too much  fitnah  in the  masjid  as anyone seeing you doing this would likely assume you were doing so from a zeal for praying at night, rather than because you are differing from them in their  fiqhi  opinion. A friend related this to me from his teacher Sh. Hashim al-Rafae'i (UAE)."
AbuIlyaas,"I was wondering why I can't have the same attachment open in two windows simultaneously?  I'm reading   this attachment  and in order to stop having to scroll up and down to read the footnotes, I tried opening it up in a second window so that I could have the footnotes on display without loosing my place in the text. But whenever I open another window with the attachment, the first window suddenly becomes blank. Any reason for this?"

And a reminder from  Abu Dawud :    Quote:    Book 41, Number 4782:  Narrated Abu Umamah:  The Prophet ( Salla Allahu 'alayhi wa sallam ) said: I   guarantee   a house in the surroundings of Paradise for a man who avoids quarrelling even if he were in the right, a house in the middle of Paradise for a man who avoids lying even if he were joking, and a house in the upper part of Paradise for a man who made his character good."
AbuIlyaas,"In addition to witnesses the woman needs the permission of her  wali  (normally her father) in order to get married.  We have  ahadith  like these:  &quot;No marriage except with a guardian ( wali ) and the ruler is the guardian of she who has no guardian.&quot;  Abu Daud &amp; others ( sahih )  &quot;If any woman marries without the permission of her guardian (wali), then her marriage is void, then her marriage is void, then her marriage is void.&quot;  Abu Daud &amp; others ( sahih )  In terms of a person who has &quot;married&quot; without the consent of a  wali   or witnesses then they should seek advice from those qualified in their community, an internet forum isn't really the place to deal with such issues."
AbuIlyaas,"At the moment I'm using IE but at home I use both, can't remember if Mozilla does it to me or not. I don't use the standard editor because I'm fussy about using things like italics in posts and writing manually [i], [b], [u], etc. gets on my nerves after a while.   I've started using IE a lot more than FireFox because of things like when I go to a site that needs a password entered; Explorer will default the cursor to the area to type in, whereas FireFox does not and I guess I'm lazy enough to find the extra mouse-click involved in moving the cursor there slightly irritating."

AbuIlyaas,I'm moving this thread over into the Corner Table so that others can respond.  Adeel is looking for:    Quote:    ... any beneficiary Islamic palm softare so far this is what i have found efatwa.com has quran and fatwasbase  and i found a palm quran (arabic)    Can anyone help?
AbuIlyaas,The IN mail service has been very intermittent over the past months. It's been up and down a lot. Some emails that have been sent to my account have taken 48 hours to arrive. Some have failed to arrive and the sender has had to resend them when they eventually got the error message.  It's also been awkward when I've needed to send mail to someone and have had to wait 24 hours or so for the service to come back online.
AbuIlyaas,I didn't see any pictures on the site of your products. The site didn't seem to be loading properly for me but I look for and didn't find any pictures of your clothes.
AbuIlyaas,"I'm still getting trouble inserting the audio. I don't hear anything when it reaches that slide. I've inserted it as a MP3 file, I can see the speaker icon but just don't seem to get any sound."
AbuIlyaas,"Jazaakum Allaahu khairan , and yeah it was a bad use of the word significance. What I meant really was have any scholars commented on it (which you answered, thank you).   The other question I had is have there been any scholatic comments on places where Allaah addresses mankind as  Insaan  rather than  Naas ? Like in  soorah  al-Infitaar  ayaah  6, Allaah says  Yaa Ayyuha-l-Insaan  rather than  Yaa Ayyuha-l-Naas?"
AbuIlyaas,"I had this exact query about two weeks ago.   A mouse got stuck in a glue trap in my house and then I had to think how to kill it so that it doesn't strave to death (like the sister mentioned).   My idea was to use a hammer and chisel but my friend started laughing and saying you can't do that. He suggested putting the glue trap inside a cereal box and then jumping on it with size 9 shoes to make it swift.    I used a slightly different method in the end.   Also, it's worth reading some of Abu Ammaar Yasir Qadhi's comments  in this thread  from al-maghrib."
AbuIlyaas,We had a drinks thread last summer too.   http://talk.islamicnetwork.com/showthread.php?t=5267
AbuIlyaas,"I only pray in that particular  masjid  out of the necessity to fulfil the obligation to make  jumu'ah . It's the only place I can realistically reach within the time I have on that particular shift. I have a number of issues with various practices inside, which I won't go into. I think there was some form of discent inside the  masjid  at the time, as some of the various comments from the crowd involved the word  namaz.     Alhamdu lillaah  the other three Fridays in a month I get pray somewhere out of choice. Everyone has their favourite  khateebs ."
AbuIlyaas,"al-Salamu 'alaykum ,  Could any of you who teach in some capacity please give me a list of the course textbooks you studied when you were learning how to teach?  I'm looking for books on lesson planning and the like, for teaching children of stage one age, i.e. primary school kids (6-7 years old).  I'd like a list of books that are actually used to train teachers, rather than me just googling myself and compiling a list of books that nobody uses.  And also, if there was one book that you'd advice a new teacher to read, what would it be?   jazakum Allahu khayran ."
AbuIlyaas,I remembered about this clip recently and thought I'd let any who were curious see a little bit about Brazilian (Gracie) Ju Jitsu.  It's a documentary about the success of the Gracie family. It's only 7 mins long.  ... and it features  Al Bundy!    http://s46.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=1...D3E5CJSDG22JWK
AbuIlyaas,And here's a bit on Ibn Sa'd's Tabaqat from Siddiqi's  Hadith Literature :
AbuIlyaas,"I'm sure that much of this would, in general, fall under being  mubaah , i.e. permissible without their being a reward or punishment for it.     However, the intention behind a  mubaah  can change it into something else. For example, as many have observed, some of these items invariably save time. So if one's intention was to increase one's time availability for more  'ibaadah  then this could change it into a  mustahab . Or, to purchase an item in order to make things easier on one's spouse, again this could be a rewardable intention. Conversely, if one's intention was to buy a better model microwave in order to compete with one's neighbours, then this could change it to something  makrooh . Or if we find ourselves buying a second microwave to save the hassle of us walking downstairs to the use the one in the kitchen, then we need to look at ourselves and ask if we are squandering wealth.       &quot;Verily, the spendthrifts are brothers of the  Shayaateen  (devils), and the  Shaitaan  (Devil/Satan) is ever ungrateful to his Lord.&quot; (al-Israa'       17:27      )       There are a whole range of intentions that could come into play with the purchase of or abstinence from particular luxury items.      As a side point, we shouldn't fall into a sufistic mentality where we purposely choose abstinence under some delusion that we are gaining reward by making things more difficult for ourself.     Narrated Aisha:      Whenever Allah's Apostle ( sallaahu 'alaihi wa sallam ) was given the choice of one of two matters, he would choose the easier of the two, as long as it was not sinful to do so, but if it was sinful to do so, he would not approach it. ( Bukhaaree   Volume:4 Book :56 Number :760 )     Allaahu A'lam"

AbuIlyaas,"I'm getting a lot of problems accessing my account.  I go to the normal password/account verification page and enter my details as per normal. Then I'm confronted with endless prompts to enter my WebAdmin password.  This happens in both internet explorer and firefox, also at home and at work.  When I type my IN account details into this prompt it just reappears again and again.  The only way I can access my IN account is if I use Outlook Express to view it. OE seems able to get passed the guard but I can't.  But the downside of using OE with my IN account is that for some reason it won't let me email anybody with a hotmail account. If I want email someone who has a hotmail account from my IN account, I have to go to the IN maill URL directly and access the account there to do it.  Any ideas?"
AbuIlyaas,Yesterday I laughed (very heartedly I might add) when David Blaine failed his stupid gold fish bowl stunt.     http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4756893.stm    I can still see the pictures in my head when he started to spasm under water and they had to dive in and save him.
AbuIlyaas,"Comment wise I've had the works. I'd say on average I get at least one comment every day (or every other day) that I go outside.   I've had:   Terrorist, Bomber, Murderer, Traitor, Jesus, Moses, Jew, Amish, bin Ladin (or just bin), Biker, Hell's angel, ZZTop, PC Beard, Freak, Santa Claus, Gnome, Dwarf, Elf (I'm not short BTW, it's a facial hair thing) and that's without mentioning all the expletives.   Threatened, spat at, laughed at, heckled, mocked, pointed at, photographed, sworn at, insulted, followed, beer can thrown at me, etc.    One that really got on my nerves was this little kid said something (forget what) and his father laughed and patted him on the back to comend him on what a good insult he'd just coined.   Someone spat on my kids once when they were out with my wife. I wasn't there and found out later.   But  alhamdu lillaah  I'd rather have all this happen to me than to be in their shoes doing it someone else.   Anyway, what can you do? *shrug*"
AbuIlyaas,"Rose,  I have just done three things in the Q&amp;A section to some of the posts you made there.  I combined your hair extension questions into one and moved it back into the &quot;Ask the scholar section.&quot;  I split some questions you had about forgetting in prayer into a new thread, as we want new questions raised in that way, rather than tagged onto the end of someone else's q.  Lastly, I just deleted a comment you added to someone's question. We want questions to be addressed by the Shaikh, it's not a place for general remarks.  I'm just posting this here as you might have noticed that I've done this. The Q&amp;A section is being directed in a slightly different fashion to other sections, please try ask questions rather than comment on them when posting in there. Jazakum Allahu khairan."
AbuIlyaas,"Jazaki Allahu khayran  sister for your post. However, as per our  Q&amp;A section rules  (See 5b) I will have to move your post into the Islamic debates section.  Forum users are free to disagree with a  fatwa  that Shaykh Isam gives and argue that an opininion that they hold is stronger, however please do not post such disagreements in the Q&amp;A section as that part of the board is purely for asking questions of the Shaykh.

AbuIlyaas,"Just so you know, I've been unable to open the email site for the last two hours."
AbuIlyaas,"The edit your post function is time restricted, we ask people to really think hard before they post.  If there is a couple (not a lot of posts) you want deleting &quot;report post&quot; them and I'll do it, insha' Allah, but I won't be doing it again so please be more careful.  Please remember this is a public forum, if you guys want a private conversation, can I suggest you take it over to email?"
AbuIlyaas,"Subhana Allah!  The main site has been seriously spammed/attacked. I've just deleted 40 comments from some clown trying to spam. Each one was in a  different  article and they seemed to be posted 10 at time,in blocks simulataneously.  There's still more to delete and I'm trying to do it. But my guess is he may have hit every single article on the site.  I think we need some immediate action, insha' Allah."

AbuIlyaas,"I've still got this  fatwaa  in my inbox from when it came up on another forum.    Quote:      AsSalaamu alaikum. I am asking this on behalf of someone. Is it permissible for a brother who sees a sister he likes, to approach her and ask her for her walee's contact details (or to leave his contact details with her to be passed onto the walee), inorder to begin consultations about marriage?      Dear questioner:     Al-Sal鈓  `Alaykum wa Rahmah Allah wa Barak鈚uh .      We would say that this is not preferred, since this could open the door  to all sorts of mischief.      If there is any other possible way to procure the needed information without approaching the girl, then that will have to be done instead.      At the very least, he can send a message to her by way of one of his  relatives or have it delivered to her by a small child.      However, we will refrain from saying that what you describe is categorically prohibited, because we do not know all of the extenuating circumstances in your society that might make what you describe an appropriate course of action under certain circumstances where no alternative course of action presents itself.      Knowledgeable scholars in you own area would be in a better position to  advise you in this matter.      And Allah knows best.      Fatw?

AbuIlyaas,Oh wait. If I click on the title of the post first  then  I can tell and see that there are comments.
AbuIlyaas,"That's weird, there is no longer lines under words that contain URL links. You just have to guess that it might be one and then hover your mouse over it."
AbuIlyaas,"As the questioner hasn't rephrased the question I shall attempt to do so:   People can be sought for marriage for a number of reasons, their religiousness, their beauty, their lineage, their wealth, etc. In Islam is loving someone considered amongst the commendable or recommended reasons for wanting to marry them?"

These two links don't answer your question sister but may give some general insight into the topic, as it discusses anaesthetic which some may argue is intoxicating.    http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=en...QR=46050&amp;dgn=4      http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=eng&amp;ds=qa&amp;lv=browse&amp;QR=21718&amp;dgn=4     One thing though which I can't seem to stop myself asking, wouldn't the  'illah  (effective cause) of any prohibition in the case you cite more likely be an intoxicating effect rather than harm to the body (which could of course could lead to a prohibition itself).   I think what we are talking about needs the making of  qiyaas  which has conditions that need to be fulfilled and is not just as simple as the layman's &quot;seems the same to me&quot;.    I think your question may need to be more specific and mention which type of medicine and the various side effects it gives. And it definately would need to be put to someone qualified to give a ruling.   Incidently, I posed the question I started this thread with to Abu Eesa Niamatullah, as he has some background in Hanbali fiqh and is also a pharmacist. I asked it recently somewhere in the comments section of his  prophetic guidance  blog. I'm at work now and his site is blocked out, so I can't cut and paste his answer at the moment but it should be easy enough to find.   I think bey is referring to the a  hadeeth  that is mentioned in this  fatwaa     http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=eng&amp;QR=20037   but as you'll read, the Sheikh does not mention the need for the one who drinks  khamr  to re-take his  shahaadah . Perhaps someone could post the  sharh  of the hadeeth that  refers  to &quot;... no one who drinks wine is a believer at the moment when he is drinking ...&quot;   Allaahu A'lam."

AbuIlyaas,"I know, I was stereotyping. 28 year old man, heavily into games, Mother reports him missing from home (suggested he possibly still lived at home with Mum). So I inferred that he was probably unmarried, as surely a wife would notice her husband gone for that long.  It also crossed my mind that he probably had a large collection of Star Wars figures and that the last pair of trousers he got were paid for and chosen by his mother, but I didn't post it as that'd be going too far.  I guess I'm just equating excessive game playing (i.e. 50 hour stretches) with sad/single bachelors."
AbuIlyaas,"I'd also like to take this opportunity to repost an advice that Muhammad al-Shareef once gave on al-maghrib forums:     Quote:    If you find your heartbeat pumping real hard DON'T POST.

AbuIlyaas,"I think you fixed something for me Sas, correct?  Anyway I tried changing the theme and re-importing the posts/comments from the puglu site.  Some things I've noticed:  1) It doesn't import completely. Some comments have been imported but I can only find them in the admin side not publicly displayed.  2) The recent comments widgets isn't accurate. It says there's comments on posts there's not.  3) I can't seem to centre a picture either in the html or the compose part of the post.  4) The blogroll isn't as manageable as it was on Puglu:  a) I can't change its name from blogroll to links. b) I can't seem to subdivide the links into categories. c) This one is really frustrating, I cannot import links from the old site to save me the hours it'd take to manually put them in again.  5) It doesn't actually import pictures, it just inserts the url for the image. So if the old site ever disappeared then all the pictures on the new site would follow suit.  6) I like the theme I have up at the moment but I'd like the comments at the end of the post rather than the start and would it be possible to edit the photo at the top?  7) Actually if there was a way to add a recent comments widget to the Puglu site, I'd probably be happy to stay there instead.  But yeah in theory MP looks better than puglu (jazahum Allahu khayra) but I'm finding puglu better in other ways and might just hang around on it."

The English translation isn't very good, it was one of Dar-us-Salam's early translations and it's difficult to read and the copy I had even had some of the pages inside twice.  There was a six cassette length class which Ali al-Timimi taught using this book, and he referred to the Dar-us-Salam translation in places (although I think he was a little critical of some of the commentary included by Dr. Muhammad Khalil Harras), which must surely be online somewhere (probably in 12 parts).

AbuIlyaas,"al-Salamu 'alaykum,  In the past weeks YouTube, Metacafe, etc have all hideously slowed down for me.  I'll start a clip and it'll play for maybe three seconds and then freeze for about 2 minutes then give me another couple of seconds of the clip and then finally decide that the whole clip is only 5 seconds long (when the info tells me it's actually 3:22) and just stop dead, asking me if i want to view it again.  Even if I download the clip it'll do the same and only download a small portion of the actual clip.  The connection speed over here is bad as it is, I'm paying way too much for 256kbps, but I don't think it's a server problem as it was ok at the start of the month. Plus a friend has the same provider and doesn't have any problems.  I've cleaned my desktop up so that there isn't many icons there, as I understand that'll slow your computer down. My recycle bin is empty and I've still got about 37 GB free on my C drive.  So what is slowing it down and why do I rarely get to see the end of a video clip on YouTube?"

AbuIlyaas,"The facility to ask questions of Shaykh Isam has been suspended until after Ramadan, insha' Allah.  In terms of your question my advice would be to just ensure that you don't actively suggest to the children to draw pictures of animate beings, just word your instructions in a way that you've asked them to do something halal and if they then go and do something prohibited they've done it of their own accord. For example, &quot;Draw a scene of tudor market place.&quot; Intending by that the children draw pictures of a cart with fruit and veg, then if they start drawing pictures of human beings they did it of their ownselves without you explicitly asking them to.  I'm having to make an extra effort to re-scan and edit out eyes on various worksheets that I'm producing for my classes but my children are only grades 1 &amp; 2. No-one has noticed yet and asked why my cats, frogs and dogs are always faceless.  Just try to be careful in your wording and leave their actions to themselves. I wouldn't give up teaching because of this, I'd just strive to find subtle ways around it and remind myself of the ayah:  &quot;So fear Allah as much as you are able...&quot; (al-Taghabun 64:16)"
AbuIlyaas,"The issue is whether a second Jumuah congregation can be held in a masjid. The purpose of the second Jumuah (at around 3.00pm) is to provide the youth , mostly middle and high school students the opportunity to fulfill their religious obligation.Presently a large number of students in this age group are missing their Jumuah Salat and are growing up with a lessening regard for this extremely important obligation. We as a community have the responsibility to facilitate the performance of the Jumuah Salat by the youth who are the future of this community. Some scholars suggest that a the students should hold jumuah at their respective schools. This in my view would not be a good solution as many students would not actually implement it if things are left entirely to them. Also there are a number of schools in a particular  locality and to organize a jumuah in all schools may not be  practical. Moreover the idea of Jumuah is to congregate people  not disperse into small groups.The purpose of obtaining an official Fatwa is to ensure that this step is in accordance with the Sharia , not an innovation or an act that may be makrooh, i.e. the legal islamic ruling on the issue. Secondly , if susbsequently someone raises an objection ,  instead of forwarding arguments we can simply refer to the FATWA.  May Allah reward you for your efforts. I look forward to your early reply and pray that the correct decision that pleases Allah comes out.   Jazaak Allah Khairan.     Sohail Ali"

AbuIlyaas,"al-Salamu 'alaykum  sister,  I am very sorry if you feel that an answer you received was in any way hostile towards you. I would, however, just like to mention that it is unfortunately from the nature of giving quick responses, such as the Shaykh does for the numerous questions posted here, that brevity or abruptness in an answer can be at times misconstrued as impoliteness or indeed hostility. It was for this reason that Shaykh Isam asked that we include this disclaimer in the  Question an Answer Section rules :       Quote:     d)   Nothing Personal :   Shaykh Isam would like to mention that he realises there may be occasions where he misunderstands a question that was asked of him, or times where his answer may appear a little abrupt or lacking in gentleness. However, he asks that you excuse him if this happens as this can be a result of his hectic schedule. So please never take something like this personally and overlook any shortcoming in him with this.    I'm sure Shaykh Isam will respond here as well insha' Allah, I just wanted to mention this.

We get to perform the  sunnah  of saying  alhamdu lillaah  after sneezing more frequently than others; plus if there are other Muslims in the vicinty we should be getting lots of  du'aa  in the form of &quot; yarhamakallaah .&quot;"
AbuIlyaas,*sad*  I liked the look/skin before this blue one.
AbuIlyaas,"OK, I think I've solved the problem I'm having.   I don't think your site is compatible with the Mozilla Firefox browser. When I go to those links you posted all I see is text.   However, if I switch over to Internet Explorer I'm able to see the pictures."
AbuIlyaas,"The designs look nice but there are  sharee'ah  related problems in wearing some of them, so I think they are limiting their potential sales.   They have T-Shirts with Allaah's name on them so this will cause problems when the wearer needs to go to the toilet.   They also have a number of T-Shirts with images of people on them which would be prohibited in the  sharee'ah  for us to wear. There is a nice quote from Al-Nawawi's  sharh  of Saheeh Muslim that Abdur-Rauf Shakir quotes in his book on  tasweer  that I'd like to quote here but it's not in front of me so I can't."
AbuIlyaas,Or just buy some spray paint and alter the sign.
AbuIlyaas,Who are these guys?     Quote:     The letter was signed by Hazrat Pir Ala'ud Deen Siddiqui; Hazrat Allama Mufti Gul Rahman; Hazrat Allama Zafar Mahmood Mujaddadi Farashwi; Hazrat Allama Professor Abdur Razzaq Shahid; Hazrat Allama Mufti Yaar Muhammad Qadri; Hazrat Allama Professor Jafar Bilal Barkati; Hazrat Allama Shabir Hussain Rabbani Maulana Qari Hafir Ur Rahman Chishti    I've never heard of any of them (and I'm not intending that as a slight) any info?
AbuIlyaas,Don't know why but I found it interesting that the extended absence from home of this 28 year old male game addict was noticed by the mother and not by any wife.
AbuIlyaas,"I don't get this!   I've been at home for four days and everything looked ok on the puglu blog. But now I've come to work, it looks all mashed up. One photo which is a reasonable size at home is absolutely  huge  when I view the site from work. It's so big it has skewed all the text.   Why does the site look so different from another PC? What can I do to prevent all this weirdness?"
AbuIlyaas,I have a new favourite every summer but one that is often up there in the top three is Snapple's Mango Madness.
AbuIlyaas,"They took the DNA sample of the spit and the database said it matched the guy that I said did it, but when it went to court it was inadmissible as evidence because after it left my hands the sample lost continuity somewhere between the Police and the Crown Prosecution Service. So in court the spit sample wasn't referred to at all (which was annoying). It was my and one colleague's word against his, plus being the spoon that he is, he turned up to court stinking of alcohol and the judge also had to warn him to stop trying to intimidate the witnesses. So he was exhibiting the type of behaviour that his defence was trying to argue he was free of.  I've still got another spit assault pending against me from some kafirah and I'm hoping that this time they'll use the DNA evidence in court insha' Allah."
AbuIlyaas,"al-Salamu 'alaykum Shaykh,  What guidelines or etiquettes would you suggest to Muslims who frequent mixed discussion forums, such as this one, in regards to interacting with the opposite sex?"
AbuIlyaas,"al-salamu 'alaykum ,  I'd just like to make forum users aware that Shaykh Isam has looked further into the issue of the  wali  for a revert. The last time this issue was mentioned and an objection was raised, he checked the opinion he had first mentioned (that a non-Muslim father can still be a woman's  wali ) and when he found Ibn al-Munthir citing that there was an  ijma ' in opposition he retracted his stance on the basis that there was an  ijma '.  However, Shaykh Isam has looked further into to this and holds that Ibn al-Munthir was incorrect in citing an  ijma ' on this matter, as both Abu Hanifah and Imam al-Shafi'i held that a non-Muslim could be a  wali  for a Muslim daughter.   Therefore, today when the question was asked again in the Q&amp;A section Shaykh Isam gave the following answer:   http://talk.islamicnetwork.com/showthread.php?t=7920"

AbuIlyaas,"Yes, I do write my own sheets too. However, I teach two grades (one manuscript and one cursive) so that's two lessons a week and due to the parental obsession for the kids (even small ones) copious amounts of homework, I often make two homework sheets as well.  The monotony of making four sheets a week has got to me and so for the class lesson I've started projecting a paragraph or two onto the big-white-screen-thingy (I'm sure there's a more technical term for it) and asking the kids to write while I go around individually checking.  I write something in Paint (the software not the stuff that tastes funny if suck instead of blow when you're making bubble pictures in art class) and then manually add guidance lines to help them gain awareness of sizing and positioning of letters. Hence the need for a &quot;good&quot; handwriting font.    Quote:     http://www.dafont.com/penmanship.font     That's an excellent font! I've downloaded and installed it now. I'm not overly keen that their tall lower case letters are 3/4 height rather than the full whack, but I could manually correct that in paint.   There's also the thing you noted where the capitals A, P and R fall under the middle but it's certainly much better than anything I've used thus far.   Jazakum Allahu khayran ! And if you do find anymore please let me know."

One thing that bugged me about Streetfighter when I grew up and looked back on it, was that they made the Brazilian character Blanca. I feel that this was a racist slight.    In many ways the Brazilians have reshaped martial arts and in particular mixed martial arts. They gave us BJJ/GJJ which has taken the world by storm; they were doing Vale Tudo contests about 70 years before they became popular in the west. Even if you wanted to take other Brazilian arts like Capoeira it would still have been a more accurate portrayal of the Brazilians than some green beast that resorts to biting the face of his opponent."
AbuIlyaas,"Ok the links weren't working properly but I've fixed them now, insha' Allah."

AbuIlyaas,"I've spoken with officers from the British Transport Police Graffiti Unit in the past and was told that there have been cases where the source of graffiti has been track maintenance contractors.   But in general, it is more often teenagers that do it. They will often break into yard areas and train depots to get that all elusive 'canvas'. I've seen secure areas with holes cut through the fencing. They can quite literally walk the length of a track at night and spray anything they find.   There have been numerous cases of injuries and even fatalities from this in the past and it is not a practice I'd advise. The track is a dangerous place at any time.   I think it's part of the pursuit of status that motivates tagging in hard to get to or even dangerous places, so that when someone sees it they go &quot;wow, how did they do that?&quot; Like bits that require hanging off bridges and the like."
AbuIlyaas,"How do we design our own theme?   I like particular fonts, don't like borders around pics, like the comments at the bottom of the post not the top, etc. Basically I'm really fussy.  Also compared to Puglu, when I stuck with the original theme I had three options under &quot;Presentation&quot;. I had these tabs:  Themes Theme Editor Header and Image Color  But in MP the Theme Editor isn't there and I only have:  Themes Header and Image Color.   Oh and another thing if I decided just to stick with the same theme I've been using on Puglu could I add a &quot;recent comments&quot; bit to the sidebar?"
AbuIlyaas,"Bilal Philips blew that joker out of the water and soon after he switched from his Nubian Hebrew nonsense to his Holy Tabernacle rubbish.  I heard a lot of people lost the plot (not that they had it in the first place) when he switched. Went back into crime or drugs, etc. It's a shame that modern day dajjals like him lead so many people astray.  There was one of his moronic shops in E. London that I used to see and some of his deluded minions used to come out on the streets to try and &quot;suss up&quot; Muslims."
AbuIlyaas,"Yes,  in shaa' Allaah  we're going. I opted to upgrade the room to one of the en-suite ones when that email came out.   I really hate when I just get into my sleeping bag and then someone says, &quot;Daddy, I want to go to the toilet&quot;; then my wife looks at me and informs me &quot;it's your turn.&quot; Plus it saves my wife having to cover just to go the loo in the morning. A small luxury, but heh! Makes me happy."
AbuIlyaas,"&quot;  [ said with sarcasm ]  I'm sorry but I don't understand sandwich!

It was a blazing argument but I had to walk away after he said this, as (despite my anger) it made me laugh and I didn't want him to see."
AbuIlyaas,"jazaakum Allaahu khairan  for that answer, especially the other  ayaat  that you cited, it was good to reading them within the context of the point you made."
AbuIlyaas,al-salamu 'alaykum  Could someone suggest or recommend a reasonably priced video editing software package?  Just so that I could cut together and edit some camcorder footage and then burn it off as a DVD.  Actually and maybe also recommend a good camcorder that I could buy?

AbuIlyaas,"al-Salamu 'alaykum ,  In preparation for the arrival of the blessed month of Ramadan, we've re-opened the  Ramadan Section  of our forum.  It's a place to exchange advice, tips and reflections on this treasured time of worship.  May Allah accept our fasting, standing (in prayer), zakat and other ' ibadat  during the coming month."
AbuIlyaas,"AsSalaamu 'alaikum,   Could anyone please give an example where this form of textual interpretation ( mafhoom al-mu kh aalafah ) has been correctly used/applied in an  ayaat  or  hadeeth . As i understand, this can be used with some restrictions applied and all I seem to have is lots of examples of how it could be  incorrectly  applied. An example of  incorrect  application would be if someone said that al-An'aam 6:145 implied that blood which is not shed forth ( dam ghair mafsooh ) is lawful for human consumption. So I really wanted a concrete example where it has been correctly used in deriving a ruling.   The  Shaafi'ee s differed with the  Ahnaaf  in their approach to  mafhoom al-mu kh aalafah  which has further confused the issue for me. How do the other  mathaahib  approach or categorise this form of textual implication and do they accept it?    Jazaakum Allaahu khairan ."
AbuIlyaas,"Shaykh, can I just check that when you say foster you are referring to those relationships that have been created by having been breast fed? Because the term foster in English is very similar in meaning to the word adopt and someone may get confused."
AbuIlyaas,"Jazaakum Allaahu khairan  for sharing that.     My wife was watching some documentary about problem teenagers and started crying. My son, just turned four, asked her why she was crying. She told him that sometimes when children grow up they behave very badly towards their parents.   My son,  maa shaa' Allaah , in an attempt to reassure her, said &quot;Mummy you do like this [ raises his hands for du'aa ]; ask Allaah to make me good.&quot;"
AbuIlyaas,I found this hilarious!  A guy goes to the BBC for a job interview. Someone pulls him out of the waiting area mistaking him for a guest on BBC News 24. They then put him on TV and start interviewing him about a recent court case.  Watch the video and in particular the bit where the presenter finishes introducing him and you see the shock on his face when he realises the mix-up ~ absolutely priceless!   http://newsbbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4774429.stm

Then reflecting upon how much it is possible to drink and the rate at which the body processes it, the answer is more likely that it is not possible to become intoxicated by this despite the small percentage present of alcohol.   And that it therefore won't fall under the  hadeeth  that probably came to your mind when you posted this.

It'll probably depend where you are located, as I understand it AOU is more expensive, so if you're in the UK I'd go for LOC. A lot of what you get out of a particular module depends on the tutor and LOC has a lot of excellent tutors.   Some personal favourites are Abdullah Zain al-Abideen, Suhaib Hasan, Ahmed Belouafi, etc."
AbuIlyaas,"Possibly not, we've lost contact with the person who wrote the last hack for us."

AbuIlyaas,"Jazaakum Allaahu khairan . So t-mobile is the better of the bunch? I'm due to renew my contract soon, but I might have it out with O2 on the phone first before I abandon ship. Just to see if they have any plans for improvement."
AbuIlyaas,"There's a twenty part lecture series by Abdur Rauof Shakir where he goes through Shaykh Suhaib's &quot;Introduction to the Science of Hadith&quot; book.   http://www.islamhouse.com/en/modules...owcat&amp;catid=17   What I listened to seemed very good.  As for the other Shaykh Suhaib book, it's basically in two parts the first is probably why it's appearing on a reading list for you. It's about six chapters looking at the origin of hadith criticism and its compilation. However, if you have Azami's  Studies in Hadith Literature  you'll pretty much cover the same material. There may be places where Shaykh Suhaib will illustrate a point with a different example than Azami uses (like I hadn't come across  these stories  before I read Shaykh Suhaib's book), so it'd be good as extra reading but depending on what your assignment is you could likely survive without Shaykh Suhaib's book if you have other resources.   The second part is where he looks at in detail into ten ahadith from Sunan Ibn Majah, these ten had been declared as maudu' by Ibn al-Jauzi and then later al-Suyuti tried to defend them. So Shaykh Suhaib looks at the sanad and weighs up the various evidence to assess who's right and from memory in almost all cases he agrees they're weak.  It's a good and interesting book and at the time of publish was an excellent resource on hadith criticism in English, but it's probably been surpassed by Azami's works or the new Kamali book which I haven't read (ask Shajaa3ah).  If can get it do so but I don't think you need to sweat it if you can't track it down, unless your doing an essay on those ten ahadith from Ibn Majah."
AbuIlyaas,"Akhee , if you have the time it's worth reading the chapter on  ijmaa'  in  this book  (p.155-179) . It gives a fair introduction on some of what's been said about what  ijmaa'  is and how it is obtained, transmitted and if it is possible to obtain, etc."
AbuIlyaas,"Ok, I'll retract my edit. Sometimes it can be ambiguous and if it's ambiguous to me it can be ambiguous to others, i.e. it has the potential to be misconstrued.  I think that as you'd quoted the entire post of Rose it swung me towards thinking it needs some 5a action. But I'll put it back after reading the  sharh  of your post.

Unlike the spoken word, the written word does not have body language and tone to contextualise a phrase, and clarify its usage.   I appreciate that we should have  husn a-Zhann  for one another. However, in general when something has the potential to be misconstrued we tend to moderate it to prevent any misunderstanding, err on the side of safety.

AbuIlyaas,"A favourite quote for me:      &quot;The coolest fool be the coolest fool&quot;    (De La Soul - In The Woods)         And in case that doesn't make sense there is a  sharh  for it elsewhere in their writings:     &quot;Who ranks the baddest brother, the ones who rule   This title is sought by the coolest fool   Define coolest fool?

AbuIlyaas,"I'm honestly a bit surprised that you haven't been asked that before. I tend to reply that it's the purity of the belief system, i.e. the  tawhid , that I find the most appealing. From a shepherd on a hill top to some high flying CEO, everyone can grasp (if Allah wills) the concept that Allah must be One. You don't need a doctorate in philosophy to act as a crutch in order to walk through life trying to articulate some bizarre idea like the trinity to others, &quot;I realise it doesn't make any sense but I'm cleverer than you are and so you'll just have to trust me on this.&quot;   So it's the simplicity, yet depth when it is studied further, of la ilaha illa Allah that does it for me.   The question that I get more often and find annoying is &quot;What do you miss most about before?&quot; Like the person cannot reconcile any belief system with sacrifice and so needs to probe me to find a weakness that they can hold up and say &quot;You see, you do miss something, I wouldn't deprive myself of this and so you must be foolish and wrong.&quot;   I tend to avoid that question because I don't see much point to it, if I was really pushed I'd probably say  Tiny Tots  (there not quite Jelly Babies) but there's no point in discussing an issue of  fiqh  with someone when their concept of God is way off."

AbuIlyaas,"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/mid...st/4625355.stm   That the Israelis actually went and found someone guilty for the murder of Tom Hurndall. They normally just white-wash stuff like this. They never, to my knowledge, prosecuted anyone for the Rachel Corrie murder, so why I wondered did they bother in this case? :huh:   It's not like the international community is  actually  going to do something about it.  Then it all made sense - the guy they are pinning it on is an 'Israeli Arab'.   Of course! He's not a real 'Israeli', he must just be part of the cancer that needs to be cleansed from Israel. So it's no big deal to throw him to the hounds. Just one less Arab to worry about. Makes sense now."

Plus I remember it from the 'look up someone with a funny name in the phone book and then give them a call' childhood days.    Which reminds me:   My company has around 17,000 employees. They tend to use abbreviations for the numeorus job titles. I, for example, am a S.S. (no Gestapo pun intended).   I was looking through a list of abbreviations that we publish internally and came across this job title, &quot;Safety Case Unit Manager&quot;, who is referred to as S.C.U.M. for short.    But the worst one I found was some poor bloke who is the &quot;Assistant Rolling Stock Engineer.&quot; I wanted to email him but I figured I might get in trouble and so resisted."

You can talk to a non-mehram if your topic is ISLAM and as long as you don't talk about things which is against ISLAM. He said its not against the ISLAM if a sister do friendship with a non-mehram brother.   Can you tell me what ISLAM says about talking to a non-mehram.

AbuIlyaas,"I think I found Blogger easier to use. I deleted the upload and changed the image size and then resaved it. However, it's decided to show a thumbnail version of the pic and won't seem to budge, it's either got to ginormous in size or some little bitty sized picture.   When you uploaded a picture on Blogger it allowed you select from three sizes that you wanted to use. I'm just finding this aspect of Puglu a bit confusing and a little frustrating."
AbuIlyaas,"if the wife is not happy living with the in-laws, is it compulsory for the husband to provide accomodaton?"
AbuIlyaas,"I'll start by reposting a post I made on this forum some time ago:  ___________________________________-  We had a similar discussion on   al-maghrib  about this.  Here's what  Islamtoday  replied when asked:    Quote:      Question       AsSalaamu alaikum. Is a Muslim woman allowed to get her navel pierced for adornment?                 Answer          Answered by: Sheikh `Abd al-Wahh鈈 al-Turayr?              This would be permissible, especially if it is considered acceptable adornment by people in your region of the world as long as there is no ensuing harm on the body. This takes the same ruling that piercing the nose or ear takes in other countries.      Muhammad al-Shareef made the following comment on al-Maghrib:    Quote:     Originally Posted by  Muhammad al-Shareef     I believe you [  answering a sister's question   here ] got some comments on another folder [ this thread ] regarding this issue (and the difference of opinion).  From an Usool Alfiqh point of view, wearing this type of ring if it's in a culture that thinks it looks alright, that it's not mutilation, and that the woman is wearing it in front of her husband, then in sha Allah it's alright.  However, this type of ring I am guessing is becoming popular because of non-Muslim women; that this young sister is asking because of non-Muslim influence. If that's the case, I would recommend that she not follow in their footsteps and seek out ways in which she may beautify herself that do not follow the footsteps of those who are not out to please Allah.                    wAllahu 'alam.     Incidentally, I personally dislike pierced navels on a woman and find them ugly with a capital 'H', but that's me I guess."

He doesn't remember until he enters into the time for  zhuhr  that he should have actually removed his socks and washed his feet, rather than wiping over his socks again, when he prayed the last  fajr .

AbuIlyaas,"Quote:     Originally Posted by  Prof   Of the many definitions of black, most of them being used for the benefit of the layman, here is what I meant: &quot;Although strictly a response to zero stimulation of the retina, the perception of black appears to depend on contrast with surrounding color stimuli.&quot; Black is the &quot;color&quot; that has (reflects) no color.     So were they your words, &quot;Black is the only color that exists in a blind man's world&quot;? I'd figured that you'd just quoted a proverb that I hadn't heard before. Like, &quot;in the valley of the blind men the one-eyed man is king.&quot; (Although I've heard that one)  The thing that I was curious about is, looking at the quote you've cited, if black is the perception of an abscence of stimuli to the retina, then what is the perception when the retina is incable of being stimulated. In other words, is the absence of colour the same as the inablity to perceive it? Does it necessarily follow that it will be perceived as black?  Would for example, a deaf person hear silence, nothing or white noise. They might not necessarily all be the same?  Questions like this seem to pop into my head alot, don't know why."
AbuIlyaas,Here is a similar question that Shaykh answered:   http://talk.islamicnetwork.com/showthread.php?t=3361
AbuIlyaas,"Incidentally, and if anyone is interested, when it comes to conflict situations that can potentially turn violent I have found the following very useful and wanted to share it.      Violence in the work place is an occupational hazard for me and I benefited from reading and implementing the advice in the attachment I've posted here.     It's a self defence stance position, which the author calls 'The Prayer Stance'. It抯 taken from Renzo Gracie抯  Mastering Juijitsu       The basic benefits are that it gives out a non-aggressive signal to the other person thus allowing time to perhaps mediate and avert violence, whilst giving you an excellent starting position to act from should things turn sour.      I use this at work when the situation arises. There was another scum-bag, neither of the ones I've mentioned so far, who I'd had an altercation with in the past at work. I saw him again but after I had read this article and implemented the advice. This time I was able to avoid things turning violent.     Lastly, I'm still getting used to my new scanner and so it's scanned as three separate pages here, whereas I'd have preferred it as one document."

AbuIlyaas,Shaykh Isam has answered about Hookah on this board before in this thread:   http://talk.islamicnetwork.com/showthread.php?t=8364   I therefore changed the title of your question to the other one that you put to the Shaykh.
AbuIlyaas,"Or, if someone really wanted to put their life at risk, there is always Kali - full contact stick fighting, with  the Dog Brothers . Just watch their promo clip   (with finger on mute, as music does come on)"
AbuIlyaas,"I like the way no-one listens to p.a. announcements on the trains/stations.   In the winter months I often start my p.a. announcements with &quot;Cold morning, ladies and gentlemen ...&quot; No-one says anything because they just assume I'm saying &quot;Good morning, ladies and gentlemen ...&quot;   I used to make Ivor the Engine &quot;SSSSsshh-t-cum, sssshhhh-t-cum&quot; noises over the p.a. system, increasing in speed, as the train pulled out of the platform - again not reaction.  On a number of occassions I've even made a p.a. saying, &quot;Attention Earthlings, we have your planet under our control, do not panic, no-one will be harmed ...&quot; No-one batted an eyelid (I was watching on the CCTV) they just kept walking."
AbuIlyaas,"Also the term &quot;traditionalist&quot; has variant meanings too. I'm more familiar with it being used to refer to those who emphasize the adherence to the authentic hadith literature also known as the traditions, i.e. ahl al-hadith.   However, in more recent times I started to become aware of a heavy emphasis from various communities in a somewhat over possessive usage of the word thereby implying a negation of scholastic continuity from their opponents, i.e we're &quot;traditional&quot; they've just landed here from the sky.  The thing is everyone claims they're adhering to the truth and all these various names, whether they arise from a self-labelling process or a name-calling exercise, are consistently used by all sides as a mechanism to distinguish opponents as being &quot;different&quot; or not being upon the truth.  I prefer to stick with the 'M' word, i.e. Muslim, and we can battle out or various theological differences as and when they come up. That way I neither pigeon hole myself or others. I'm a Muslim, you're a Muslim, we're Muslims - it's much easier on the tongue."
AbuIlyaas,"I can understand that your position could be identifiable without you actually making a call but it seems a bit of a stretch that your voice can be picked up when you're not using your phone. The article only says &quot;Some phones may still transmit information to the network or be accessible from the network even though the user has switched them off.&quot; And from the context of the article the &quot;information&quot; would seem to be your global location rather than any sounds you utter, otherwise why would anyone even need to bug your phone to hear you when they could do it remotely anyway?   I've heard the echo effect though and that's a bit scarey but I think everyone needs to understand that a telephone isn't a secure means of communication anyway.

Quote:    Sa'id ibn Mansur says: &quot;A person should not be an imam for another where the other is in authority except with his permission.&quot; The meaning of this is that the one in authority, owner of a house, leader of a meeting, and so on, has more right than others to be the imam if he has not granted the permission to any of the others. Abu Hurairah reports that the Prophet sallallahu alehi wasallam said: &quot;It is not allowed for a man who believes in Allah and the last day to be an imam for a people, except with their permission, nor may he specifically make supplications for himself without including them. If he does so, he is disloyal to them.&quot; This is related by Abu Dawud."

AbuIlyaas,"al-salamu 'alaykum ,  Someone asked me to recommend a DVD for someone that they're trying to give da'wah to. I wasn't sure what to suggest and so I thought to ask here to see if anyone else could recommend some titles (I'm saying DVDs because I'm not sure how receptive he'd be to audio).  He describes the guy as from Muslim parents but himself an agnostic, although he's recently climbed down slightly from being a hardcore atheist.   He's interested in current affairs issues that are also of concern to Muslims, like Palestine and Guantanamo. Or cultural things like Islamic architecture or *cough* Sufi music (don't recommend music though, I'm just mentioning this to give you a picture of what he's about).   So maybe something about an intellectual topic but that has a subtle undercurrent of da'wah in it. Sort of sweet tasting medicine so that he doesn't realise he's been given it.  Any ideas?"

AbuIlyaas,"There was a restaurant that I saw on The Green that made me a little uneasy.    Salaam/Namaste The Restaurant   It's got a big halal sign outside, no smoking or alcohol permitted inside, &quot;All meat products are halal in origin&quot; disclaimer on the menu (and I checked the menu and there's no pork) and even a double &quot;a&quot; in the transliteration of salaam for those that like the attention to detail.  But...  I'm sure [read: think here] it's owned/run by Sikhs. The waiter inside has the little power silver bangle thing on his arm (Someone else had a red string one and the other waiter wore gold-ish rings), there's a funny looking copper model temple at the desk, and in general something just didn't feel right inside.  I tend to get excited when I see a sign that says halal Chinese food (which this restaurant does), as it's so rare to be able to get something like halal sweet'n'sour chicken.   I understand that a Sikh could buy halal meat and prepare a meal that would technically be lawful for me to eat, but I'd just feel more comfortable if the shop was more open and put a sign like:     &quot;Halal food (But just so you know, we're Sikhs)&quot;   Does anyone happen to know anything about this restaurant?"

A question was posed after the lecture finished on the  fatwa  that had been reported in the press.

AbuIlyaas,"Shaykh, as the questioner hasn't rephrased their question I shall attempt to do so.  We have read in surah al-baqarah 2:102 that one form of magic that those who indulge in it have learned is to separate between husband and wife:  &quot;... And [yet] they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife. But they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of Allah.&quot;  Is there anything authentically narrated that the people who practice such arts have learned how to make a person fall in love with someone against their will?   Because we meet people who claim to have had this done to them and sometimes blame their sinful behaviour on it. And we also meet Muslims who claim that they can relieve the effects of such a spell, for a fee, after having diagnosed someone as suffering from it."
AbuIlyaas,"Really, then 'no'. I'd probably just walk out. The thing is with these sort of publicity stunts people who actually have got probing questions to ask tend to give themselves away with their facial expressions/body language and so they don't get picked because they don't want to make a scene. They tend look for some doofus who's going to ask &quot;Do you have Coca Cola in your country?&quot;   But your approach is right try, try to ask a question that will hopefully educate the audience.   Here's a topical one from the Danish outrage:     Quote:    Editors of a  Jordanian  and a French newspaper who chose to republish the cartoons have been dismissed.      From BBC    &quot;Will you be applying the  hadd  on any Jordanians involved in this?&quot;"
AbuIlyaas,"Book wise I'm apparently also the dictionary, although as a xenophobe I'd prefer to have been called the Oxford English dictionary over Merriam-Webster.  Country wise I'm alledged to be Italy!        You're Italy!     You pretty much feel like you are the most long-standing bastion of civilized humanity on the face of the earth. While this is probably not true, you do have a noted history of living the good life and spreading culture to those around you. More recently, however, things have started to slide and you're having a hard time staying together and not getting beaten up. People still like to ask you how it was to be the center of high culture, but your days at the top are long past you. Avoid volcanoes, flooding, and unstable buildings wherever possible."
AbuIlyaas,"Jazaakum Allaahu khairan , I'll be setting off soon and this has helped a lot."
AbuIlyaas,"Quote:     Originally Posted by  AbuMuqatil   3. Owned-slave without an owner - how?

Then according to  istishaab  the slaves ownership is presumed to continue until such time as it would normally be expected for the owner to have died (i.e. an estimation of a normal life span), at which time the slave would be divided up (not literally) amongst his heirs. Until such time the slave is owned but ownerless?"
AbuIlyaas,"There is actually a funny video where some BJJ guys challenge some Yellow Bamboo practitioners to test their 'repelling' skills. But the video has a dodgy link on the film and someone will probably be dumb enough (I was) to go to the link expecting other funny videos, when it turns out to be something offensive.  I found the video on an MMA site but I'll not post it as I'm not clever enough to be able to blur out the url it shows on the video."
AbuIlyaas,"Quote:          &quot;It would appear that,  despite what parents may think , kids are assimilating into the society and picking up the habits of the society very quickly ?both the good and the not-so-good,&quot;                       I think that parents who think their children aren't assimilating are niave at best.            I still feel shocked today when I reflect upon the number of people who I didn't realise were Muslims in my youth and only realised later in life when I became more familiar with Muslim names.             Another story which illustrates the extent to which people from Muslim backgrounds are assimilating into Western culture is here:               Gay Pakistan - Less inhibited than west               (some of the reader comments on that article are worth reading)"
AbuIlyaas,"Tahir Qadri, the guy who's the amir of minhaj al-Qur'an? He's a huge Barelvi!"
AbuIlyaas,"Quote:    Sheikh al-Islam Ibn Taymiyya said, that Greek logic is a science that an intelligent person is not in need of, and an idiot cannot benefit from.    I saw it on  as-Sahwah  and liked it."
AbuIlyaas,I learnt that sometimes I can restrain myself from  making a joke .

AbuIlyaas,"If it's sticks your after then try Kali, check out some of the  video clips  of the Dog Brothers in action."
AbuIlyaas,"I think sometimes at the time you name your kids a phrase or a person just isn't well known, so you don't know what you are letting your kids in for in the future. Like there are some children called Harry Potter today, but named long before Ms Rowling made the name famous.  Or there was this boy at school I knew called &quot;Benjamin Hill&quot;. The one time I made the observation and said &quot;Ha! That's like Benny Hill!&quot; he punched me in the stomach and winded me, so I never mentioned it again."
AbuIlyaas,I have learnt that I exhibit more control over my fingers than my tongue. I lament more often over what my tongue sends forth than I do my fingers.  To redress this balance I'd need to install some sort of &quot;Preview Speech&quot; and &quot;Submit Speech&quot; function.
AbuIlyaas,"It's actually amazing the lack of fear or a lack of dependency on conforming to societal norms (like politeness) that kids have.    I remember coming out of my house with my daughter as an Asian woman walked passed and my daughter piped up in a very loud voice, &quot;Daddy, she's not wearing  hijaab !&quot; The woman embarrassed just smiled and I was left with the dilemma of trying to explain to my daughter the concept of using  hikmah  in  da'wah;  and the need to balance this with enjoining the right and forbidding the wrong."
AbuIlyaas,"I've copied this from al-Maghrib as I thought it was interesting, although I'm a little apprehensive about it.   The first bit is an advert for a new book by T.O. Shanavas which appears to argue that Evolution was a Muslim idea that Darwin pinched.   The second bit is a review that the same author gave of some of Harun Yahya's writings, in which he is highly critical of Harun Yahya.   I haven't read, nor do I own, the Shanavas book. But I'm hoping that it's not another one of these books where an author tries to prove that Islam confirms science at all costs.    Scientists seem to change opinions every few years and I have often heard  du'aat  critical of the obsession of some who focus on highlighting where science and the Qur'an coincide. If Allaah has said something it is sufficient for me.   I'd always understood that Islam was clear that Adam (` alahi salaatu wa salaam ) was created in his adult form without having evolved from another species   Anyway I thought I'd share these two posts."
AbuIlyaas,I'm getting &quot;connection to the server has failed&quot; messages again when I try through outlook and &quot;site may be down&quot; prompts when I try through IE or Firefox directly.

AbuIlyaas,Here's an audio Q&amp;A with Shaykh Jamal Zarabozo and Shaykh 'Ali al-Timimi (May Allah hasten his release) on female circumcision.     Excerpt from the general Q&amp;A session of the 1997 JIMAS conference.
AbuIlyaas,"Shaykh, I just want to add a note where the brother mentioned utilising samples.  A particular human sound can be recorded and then this sound can then be played through a keyboard at different notes to which it was recorded, various effects can added, it can be played rhythmically, or in conjuction with other human sounds to create different sounds. The end result whilst technically having an origin in the human voice can at times be beyond what a human voice could have achieved in isolation."

AbuIlyaas,I believe where Shaykh refers to bisexuals he is meaning hermaphrodites not bisexuals. As bisexuals are physically either male or females (not both) but whose deviance makes them seek partners from both genders during their lives. Hermaphrodites on the other hand are people born with both sets of sexual organs and Shaykh has explained the ruling on them above.
AbuIlyaas,"Yeah, I see that too whenever I come here without being logged in."
AbuIlyaas,"I saw it on BBC 24 last night there's this four year old boy in India who they are hailing as India's next big sport's star. He just ran and completed a forty mile race (Seven hours running) and they're bringing over to the UK shortly to take part in a marathon over here.   Here's an older story about him when he was three:  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4241958.stm    My experience of young children is that once they've been out for a bit they kind of go all floppy and start saying &quot;Carry me!&quot; or they just fall asleep where they are; my son once fell asleep whilst standing up and I had to catch him.   Subhana Allah, It's just truly amazing that a child of 4 could run 40 miles!"

AbuIlyaas,"It's also nonsense!  There's another funny martial art which its advocates take seriously, I just can't remember the name. Their website has a photo gallery of the grandmaster that developed it and he looks like Chewbacca. I'll try and find it."
AbuIlyaas,"That reminds of 2002 when they invaded Jenin and The Independent Newspaper found evidence that they had run over a disabled man (still in his wheel chair) with one of their tanks. They found the mangled remains of his wheel chair.  They only distinction the IDF seem to make between Palestinians is that some are 'alive' and some are 'dead'. Women, child, baby, disabled, all this terms mean nothing. Even someone that they see as 'alive' is probably more likely defined as 'dead (pending)' in their eyes."
AbuIlyaas,Shaykh Isam answered a similar question here:   http://talk.islamicnetwork.com/showthread.php?t=5767
AbuIlyaas,"It's lol-ing when replying to someone of the opposite gender, click the  forum rules  link for more info. There isn't much space in the 'reason for edit' box so we're kind of forced to be concise when explaining what we've done. No offense was intended."
AbuIlyaas,"We ended up getting 'Aston &amp; Parsons' because we asked the chemist what they'd recommend, I saw Orajel on the shelf but we'll give this a go first and maybe go back if it's not too effective.   It's been a long time since I've looked at the ingredients of Bongela, I just remember that I didn't buy it for my first born on the basis of what I read on the ingredients list. They may have changed their product since those days but I thought I spotted Gelatin at the time, I could be wrong.    Jazakum Allahu khayran  for everyone's advice."
AbuIlyaas,"I'm just curious, how many different 'hover messages' there are. As your rep points increase you get a different message come up when you hover over a person's green squares.

AbuIlyaas,"al-salamu 'alaykum Shaykh,  I have often heard it said that the Zoroastrians were al-majus mentioned in al-Hajj 22:17. Is that a false tafsir, do we have any knowledge of who al-majus were, or is this just a purely speculative attribution?"
AbuIlyaas,"Jazaakum Allaahu khairan ,   So how do you view everyone's reputation, number of points, etc? Also, can you disable it, because I went to another site and found someone with a black square and the &quot;hover message&quot; said &quot;*** has disabled reputation&quot;?   Off topic, but I thought to mention that I think the 'sheikh' emoticon looks like he's got horns.   Even though, I'm still in favour of bearded and hijaabed smilies."
AbuIlyaas,"Messages of support can be sent to:   support@freetalhaahsan.com   Some messages will be published on the site  here , if you don't want it published or you don't want your name mentioned, then state that in your email,  insha'  Allah.  ______________  As always in these situations, the family is amongst the hardest ones hit. I witnessed both yesterday and today (community meeting &amp; protest outside the court room) Talha's father ( hafizhahullah ) trying to express his feelings about his son's arrest. On both occassions the tears were very visible; it was hard enough for me to watch him speak, I can't imagine the pain that a father, a spouse, a sibling, a child, or a loved one must experience in such a situation. And,  Qaddar Allahu wa masha'a fa'l , this has become all to common in our community nowadays; loved ones being wrenched from their families,  wa Allahu al-musta'an .  A recurring point that was made at the community meeting is that it is very important   not   to abandon family members of detainees. What is often the case in situations like this is that people start to cut off from the families out of a fear of guilt by association. That by somehow associating with them, they will get in trouble. However,  know  that this is from Shaytan ( la'natu Allahu 'alayh ), the vultures have began circling around your brother or sister and Shaytan wants you to turn your back and walk away, lest you scare them from finishing their meal.  Rather, what we should to is surround a family like this with love, support, help, even simply just asking them how they are doing at regular intervals.  That's why we should truly thank Allah for organisations like  HHUGS   (Households Under Great Stress) who have taken on board this vitally important role."

AbuIlyaas,"It's a form of platting the hair and can be done in a number of ways.    It can be done by simply platting, which is temporary.   By using hair extensions weaved into the hair which is again temporary but uses false or other people's hair in the process.   Or it can be done by matting the hair together into clumps using a substance like honey or the like, to initially make it stick. This tends to be more permanent and has to be cut out (rather than washed) when a person wants to remove it. Water can still reach the scalp in washing, despite the hair being in clumps."
AbuIlyaas,"al-Salamu 'alaykum ,  In 2001 Ali al-Timimi gave a lecture called &quot; The Position of Palestine in Allah's Revelation &quot; at the JIMAS conference. It proved to be a very popular lecture and was constantly requested for purchase the subsequent years.  However, those who heard the lecture live in comparison to the generally circulated version, will know that the very end of the lecture is cut slightly short on the recording. There was no sinister motive to this it was merely that the cassette, MP3, and the CD version of the lecture that were circulated were all taken from the same source.  Being the train-spotter that I am and because a couple of brothers complained when they noticed this discrepancy, I found out that the lecture when taken instead from the video cassette contains the full length talk.  I have therefore converted it to MP3 and having cut off the 3 minute introduction, this version that I'm sending here is the complete lecture (including the missing 8 minutes or so from the ending).   http://www.yousendit.com/transfer.php?action=download&amp;ufid=3C06548520BEAE6C     Please continue to make  du'a  for the Shaykh who has been unjustly imprisioned."
AbuIlyaas,"I thought AbdurRaheem Green made a very good point on  his blog  when he first started it. I'd never thought of it this way before:     Quote:    When you think of paradise, what sort of images come to your mind? Palm trees, soft white sandy beaches and a tepid azure blue sea. A clear soft blue sky and shapely beauties smiling coyly as they offer you a cocktail of delicious fruits with a hint of something else underneath the shade of a palm tree gently moving in the warm soft breeze? Don抰 get me wrong, I don抰 mind the idea of that either but when I had a dream of paradise it was a beautiful house over a rocky crag in a forest of pine trees that once you clear them leads to miles of nearly empty untouched snow down mountains and hills?and then I ski and ski and ski?."
AbuIlyaas,"Sister g_mafia_don, I took the liberty of undeleting your post as sister UmmKhubayb confirmed that you were correct. The thread makes more sense (in my mind) with it undeleted. If you object to me doing this then I can re-delete it, insha' Allah."

AbuIlyaas,I'm laughing because the examples cited seem to be very male on female emotional blackmailing. So in order to balance the scales I'll post a h-y-p-o-t-h-e-t-i-c-a-l (i.e. don't go getting me in trouble) example of female on male emotional blackmailing.    Male : &quot;What's wrong?&quot;    Female : &quot;Nothing&quot;  [sulks for two days]    Male feels guilty but doesn't understand why and starts going out of his way to make up for something that is totally lost on him.
AbuIlyaas,"There was an urban myth at university that I heard. Someone was given a question in the final year of his psychology degree, &quot;What is risk?&quot; He wrote, &quot;This is risk&quot; and then walked out of the exam. The legend goes that the examiner loved it and gave him an 'A' for that paper. If only life were that simple!  One of my friends, who dropped out after the first year of Uni, hated chemistry and the department head. He only turned up to the exam so that he wouldn't be made to pay a fine. So after the exam began he spent two minutes drawing mushrooms on the answer sheet and then walked up to the guy, who happened to be moderating the exam, put the sheet in his hand, smiled in his face and left."

AbuIlyaas,"wa 'alaykum salam,  The mistakes in al-Tahawi are very few in number, many scholars pointed them out, it's not something that the book is abandoned for. It is definitely from the books of ahlus-Sunnah, as is the commentary on it by Ibn Abi al'Izz.  The concise books on aqidah tended to be written in response to particular fitan that were prevalent at the times. In Hamawiyah Ibn Taymiyyah deals with different areas than al-Tahawi did, it goes into the names and attributes of Allah and the corruptions that were circulating at that time. Both books are still very much relevent today."

AbuIlyaas,"I don't know enough about the subject but I believe one's diet can help. Perhaps Ismiyy could give some sort of summary of supplements or things to leave in or out of your diet. I got the impression that he has some sort of background in that, could be wrong.    I seem to remember reading in the biography of Imam al-Nawawi, in the intro of Jamal Zarabozo's   sharh  , that the Imam used to avoid drinking cold water when he was studying as it made him sleepy. I'm not suggesting to that, just trying to establish that there can be other factors that influence laziness.   Allahu A'lam."

Add a small tin of tomato puree. Once that's good and mixed up, add enough water to take it up to a soup level. Once it's simmering add some chopped celery. I think simmer for about 40 mins. The last ingredient is some broken verimicilli (pasta) once that becomes soft it's ready. I was told that rather than verimicilli you can also use broken bulgar wheat (which I think was called freak by Algerians?)     Yeah Shurba a classic Ramadhan dish (although i dont like it), it's usually made with wheat (burghul) never seen it made with verimicilli , and yes in Algeria and Tunisia they call their Shurba Frik."

AbuIlyaas,"This is a difficult thread to post in, as a lot of my naiveties in my childhood may infringe forum rules if I were to post them; but my wife laughed when I told her some things that I used to believe.      [I hope this next one isn't too close to the line but feel free to delete it if any mods think it is]      Regarding the 'Birds and the Bees'. My mother told me that &quot;... when a man loves a woman very much he plants a seed in her and it grows into a baby.&quot;     For a long while after I firmly believed that this was some sort of paranormal phenomenon. That when a certain degree of 'love' was reached in the man, the woman just suddenly became pregnant without any form of physical contact. Sort of like telekinesis. This can have repercussions, in that if you loved someone from a distance and without them knowing it, they could suddenly find themselves pregnant!       Here's a safer one from my daughter, who is now five. We had an extended weekend not long ago, as the Monday was a public holiday. Then when I was taking her to school on the Tuesday my daughter rebuked me, &quot;Daddy, the next time we have a holiday you have to take me to the bank!&quot; &quot;Why would I want to do that?&quot; I asked. &quot;Cos, it's a bank holiday, you're supposed to take me to the bank.&quot;         [In case that doesn't translate internationally, many public holidays in the       UK       are called 'bank holidays']"
AbuIlyaas,"I'm extremely suspicious about the authenticity of these statistics.   Are they trying to tell me there are more people who selected 'Jedi' than there are Sikhs in the UK? I see Sikhs every day and in the four years that have passed since the census I haven't met one person who said he put 'Jedi' on the form. Nor did I see these allegedly widely circulated emails telling people to put 'Jedi'.    Don't forget when you fill out the census you are asked to put the religion of any minors (children) in your household. I suspect that most of these 'Jedis' are single batchelors, without children, so where did all these numbers come from?   In fact the only reference I've seen to this nonsense has been in the media. Which is invariably going to multiply the amount of these morons by spreading the knowledge of this nonsense.   I'd like to see these fools try and laugh this one off when the angels come to them and ask them the questions in the grave. Try telling them that your religion was 'Jedi Knight' smart guy!"

AbuIlyaas,"Where is the quote from, as it doesn't look like it's from Islam q-a as they don't normally transliterate like that?   If a sister in this country were concerned about whether or not she should be studying in a mixed environment I'd suggest that she approached someone in this country who is qualified to derive rulings and is familiar with the needs of the community here.    The issue could be construed as a matter of  maslahah mursalah  and the ruling could vary according to what is being studied. Whether a greater harm is perceived in a sister training in medicine (for instance) in a mixed environment so that other sisters will be able to seek help from Muslims in the future, or whether the harm in free-mixing is greater.   Shaikh Haitham al-Haddad is available for telephone questions on 0207 471 8270.

You also addressed your question to the brothers and sisters of the forum and had I left it in the 'ask the scholar' section it would not reach the wider audience that you asked.  A similar question to yours was asked in this thread  http://talk.islamicnetwork.com/showthread.php?t=6036  .  In general, we know that seeking knowledge is incumbent upon both the males and females in Islam as the Messenger ( sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam ) told us 揝eeking knowledge is an obligation upon every Muslim.?[  Sunan Ibn M鈐ah  ]  If your friend and his wife are arguing excessively and looking for someone to judge between them then they are better to approach a Qadhi (judge) who can listen to both sides of the argument and assist them in reconciling or judge between them if necessary. It would be a good idea to suggest to them that they approach their local Imam who could either serve this role himself or refer them to someone who could.  If you don't know of any such individuals in your area then perhaps you could mention which area you are in and the brothers and sisters of this forum could maybe suggest someone to you.  May Allah reward you for your concern for your friend and help you to find someone suitable to arbitrate between them if this is necessary.  Perhaps some of the brothers and sisters of this forum would like to add some beneficial words in answer to your query?   Jazakum Allahu khayran ."

Were it permissible for a human being to prostrate to another human being, I would have commanded the woman to prostrate to her husband because of his great right upon her.

Royce popped Jason's arm, made the elbow bend the other way. Without downloading this myself first (as I need to sleep) I think it's either  this  or  this one ,    Actually, neither link was the fight I was thinking of. They are both clips of the same closed-door match. The Gracies had an open challenge to anyone who wanted to fight them, in order to prove their style is better.

AbuIlyaas,"May Allaah reward all of those who've helped in this campaign.   Quote:     Originally Posted by  musaafirah 57   Also, a clarification on the permissability of hunger-strikes and petitioning to non-Muslim authorities was also provided by Dr. Tarhuni and Shaykh `Adly, may Allaah reward them for their support in this cause.     Sister, I'm not warning against anything here or trying to work against this campaign but I would like to ask if you could provide some more information regarding what Dr. Tarhuni and Shaykh `Adly said about the permissibility of hunger strikes. I am asking purely to understand this from a  fiqh  perspective and not intending to harm any efforts that are being made to help our brother and others like him.   I just wanted a little elaboration on the issue if this is possible please. I'm not asking about the petition, as I'm struggling to see any  shar`ee  objection to petitioning. However, when I have previously heard of hunger striking I have always wondered whether such an action would be deemed permissible or not.   Purely on the basis of the purposes of Islaamic law ( al-maqaasid al-Sharee`ah).  One of the five essential values ( al-darooriyyat al-khamsah ) that the  sharee`ah  strives to protect is life ( al-nafs ). So when I heard of this issue (i.e. hunger striking) not specifically about this case. I wondered what the ruling on purposely abstaining from food in protest - an action which can bring much harm and even death to oneself - would be viewed under Islaamic law?   I'm not attempting a refutation of this action, I am just asking if you could elaborate on what these scholars said on this issue, as it is one which I do not understand?    Jazaakum Allaahu khairan .   And may Allaah (al-Shaafee - the One who cures) grant our brother the medical assistance that he needs and end the oppression against him (and others) -  ameen!"

AbuIlyaas,"Yes correct,  maa shaa' Allaah !   Jaraad ."
AbuIlyaas,I have this strange feeling that I've had a conversation about  d 閖?vu   before.
AbuIlyaas,Assalamualaikum Shaikh.     Is it permissible for women to cut their hair in order to maintain it and can we dye our hair ( henna or artificial dying) ?
AbuIlyaas,"wa 'alaykum salam,  Just to let you know that I don't have these files with me at the moment and can't re-upload the lecture. Maybe someone else could?"
AbuIlyaas,It's probably a typo but it's worth pointing out that it's Abu Muntasir and not AbdulMuntasir.  I don't recollect Nuh Keller ever being invited to a JIMAS conference though?
AbuIlyaas,The one that there is a lot of kalaam about at the moment. E.g.  'No thanks' to Tariq Ramadan.
AbuIlyaas,"wa 'alaykum salam,  Yes, I posted it in this thread post number 9 (although my cassette didn't have the 's' on the end of faith).   They've recently uploaded it on the Upon Sunnah audio site ( part one ,  part two ). And it is the one from Shaykh Suhaib's masjid as he refers to it at the beginning of the lecture."

It is sort of famous for high flicky kicks. Plus, I believe, in Tae Kwon Doe as a sport, they don't allow kicks below the waist (someone can correct me if I'm wrong as I've never trained it). One of the Muay Thai trademarks, if you like, is the low kick to the thigh and inner leg.    To the best of my research Muay Thai is regarded as one of the most effective striking based martial arts."
AbuIlyaas,"A Reminder to the Married Brothers   by Abu Hanifa Adam Abdullah  (pre-Islam Channel days, London 2000)                 An excerpt from a lecture on the &quot;Weakness of Iman and its Cures&quot;. Abu Hanifa gives an advice to the married brothers to continue to study even after marriage.  I'm still experimenting with the audio programs here and so I haven't sussed how to ditch the clicking sound yet."
AbuIlyaas,"I haven't posted the story before. I've always meant to have a proper go at writing it up because writing can be fun. I've held off doing it thus far because I wanted to make sure I did it properly. I have just never got around to it.  In shaa` Allaah , I'll give it a go and post it when I've finished."
AbuIlyaas,"It's simply a case of having some equality in how we deal with posts. If we would edit a sister's post that might cause fitnah for some (not everyone) then we should do similar for a brother's post. There's no accusation of self flattery, flirting or ill intent attached to it.   If someone replies to a sister for instance with a smiley emoticon, I'll edit it out of their post purely because our gender relation policy on the board doesn't allow it. I'm not implying that the brother was try to hook up with the sister, it's just our board takes things like this out of the mix in an attempt to reduce fitnah.  Sami Yusuf is clearly fitnah for some sisters, so why should a statement that a person has often been likened to him be treated any differently from a statement by a sister on the board who says she's often been mistaken for a woman that is fitnah for some brothers.  It's not really a big deal, our board has a gender relation policy, others don't. You can love or hate the policy but I personally feel that it makes things more conducive towards an environment of modesty and respect.  I also think it's not worth arguing about. A post was edited, it happens, now lets just move on."
AbuIlyaas,Maa shaa' Allaah!   I'm just so excited and hyped up about Jannah! May Allaah grant us all a place in it -  ameen .

AbuIlyaas,"I have understood that it is permissible (although not recommended) to sleep whilst in a state of  janabah  (major ritual impurity).  However, I have always wondered about reconciling these two  ahadith :  On 慉mmar bin Yasir, that the Messenger of Allah ( salla Allahu 慳layhi wa sallam ) said: 揟here are three which the angels will never approach: The corpse of a disbeliever; a man who wears perfume of women;  and one who has sex until he performs  wudu? .?( Abu Dawud , Ahmad and others:  Hasan )  And the famous hadith of Abu Hurayrah regarding  ayat al-kursi , where the shaytan who had been caught stealing from the  zakat  told him 揥henever you go to bed, recite  ayat al-kursi  till you finish the whole verse. (If you do so), Allah will appoint a guard for you who will stay with you and no shaytan will come near you till morning.?The Messenger ( salla Allahu 慳layhi wa sallam ) confirmed 揌e really spoke the truth, although he is [absolutely] a liar.?(Bukhari)  So my question is: If a person goes to bed and recites  ayat al-kursi  (and Allah appoints a guardian for them until the morning, which I was told is an Angel) and then they approach their spouse and becomes  junub , if they sleep in this state do they lose their guardian on the basis of the first hadith?"
AbuIlyaas,"I am allowed to say this? You can just delete it and say 'no' in the reason section, I don't mind. But it did actually happen.   Not long on the  deen , so I was still a little naive, I was invited around to a friends house for  iftaar  there were loads of people there. I'd never seen so many different dishes in one sitting (outside of a restaurant).   The central piece was a whole lamb lying on a bed of rice. I was really impressed about how differently Muslims prepared dishes. I was used to everything coming straight from packets, the only (nearly) whole animal I'd seen prepared before Islam was a chicken or fish.   My host was trying make me feel very welcome and kept telling me to eat. He asked me &quot;Have you tried the balls?&quot;   I was totally shocked and looking at the lamb asked, &quot;Do you eat them as well?&quot;   He just looked at me in disbelief and motioned towards the balls of mince-meat with the accompanying dip on another plate."
AbuIlyaas,"Maybe later,  in shaa' Allaah . I'll try and write a draft and see how it reads to me first. I tend to find people expect a 'I saw the  ka'bah  in my dreams then found out about Islam' type story and are a little disappointed when I mention that it just made perfect sense when I heard about it and so I accepted."
AbuIlyaas,"But I want to post something now, Thursday is far"
AbuIlyaas,"Jazaakum Allaahu khairan , that puts it more into perspective for me."
AbuIlyaas,"Jazaki Allahu khayran .  It kind of illustrates the gender differences though because that number is more than half the total number of posts in the Brothers' Section.  And I'm not implying that you are posting more than anyone else in the sisters' section, I'm just guessing that the sisters' section is exponentially bigger than the brothers'."

AbuIlyaas,"al-Salamu 'alaykum,  I'm not aware of one, I was even surprised to find out that someone had compiled a pdf of it."
AbuIlyaas,"There's also another Shafi'i book in English al-Nawawi's Minhaj et-Talibin. However, the English version was translated from a French translation and not directly from the Arabic, so I've been mistrusting of it. A book loses a lot when it passes through one language let alone two. I was given a copy but I've kind of just left it on my bookshelf.   I, personally, would not recommend the English translation of al-Risala (which is a book on  usul  rather than  fiqh ), simply because they've translated important  usul  terminology rather when it would be better left transliterated. So there are times that you're not sure what exact principle is being discussed because important terms haven't been preserved. So unless you're actually going through the book with a teacher or are reading it alongside the Arabic text, I wouldn't suggest it be bought or read as there are much clearer books (IMO) on  usul  in English.   Yeah I enjoyed Dr. Saleh's book. It doesn't cover  fiqh  but contains a lengthy refutation of the more ecentric aspects of Sufism. I actually found the book hilarious at times, as it's absolutely gob smacking what some of the Sufis have done or the karamat that they have claimed. Excellent read, I know one Islamic bookshop (which leans towards  tasawwuf ) that won't stock it because of the complaints they received when they did.     wa Allahu a'lam"

AbuIlyaas,"It's been a long time since I've heard him refer to this issue. From memory, there were two things that I can recall him taking issue with: (i) the genealogy, him not being Quraishi as he suggested; and, (ii) the authenticity of those  ahaadeeth  that refer to black banners coming from Khurasaan.   There were are number of statements he made in various lectures regarding these issues. I have had more success in tracing him referring to the first issue:  This is from the sisters Q&amp;A at the 1999 JIMAS conference.     Quote:     [reading the question]  Which country will the Mahdi come from? There is no  hadeeth,  as far as I know, saying where he will come, but the  bay'ah , which will be given to him will given to him in Makkah. Will he come from another place from out [of] Arabia or from Arabia? He is one of the children of 'Alee, the children of Faatimah, so he is from the house of the Prophet ( Sallaahu 'alaihi wa Sallam ). And I want to warn you here, many people from time to time, they come and they say we are from the house of the Prophet ( Sallaahu 'alaihi wa Sallam ) and say we are Quraishee and some they say give me  bay'ah,  I'm  khaleefah.  Okay? [you] should not listen to anyone who claims that, because, this ... the tree of the Prophet ( Sallaahu 'alaihi wa Sallam ) and this genealogy has to be traced and checked. Not anyone who claims, for instance, one who is claiming now he is from the house of the Prophet ( Sallaahu 'alaihi wa Sallam ) and he is Rafaa'ee. Rafaa'ee is the tribe Rafaa'a, it's not from Quraish, and he claims he is from the house of the Prophet ( Sallaahu 'alaihi wa Sallam ). So the Mahdi is from the house of the Prophet ( Sallaahu 'alaihi wa Sallam ) and the bay'ah will be given to him in Makkah. And this is what we know from the  hadeeth .    Did I get this right, Abu Eesa is al-Rafaa'ee, yes?  Also sister, a small point but it is Saalim rather than Saleem."

AbuIlyaas,"I think it's supposed to be customary to tip 10% of the bill, unless the bill explicitly mentions service is included. That's what I was told anyway was the custom in London.   From what I saw in my youth, some waiters nick the tips themselves and only put a small portion of it in 'the pot' for sharing with everyone. So if you're intending the tip to reach the chef it might not be reaching them. If you're in a restaurant when a waiter waves goodbye to his colleagues, then listen to his shoes as he walks past. If you hear a sliding clunking sound as he passes there is probably a portion of the night's tips inside.   If a taxi driver helps me with my shopping bags to the door of my house without me asking me he gets a tip, if he don't then I don't."

Anywhere on the net where I could safely install .amr support software?"
AbuIlyaas,"These are my spare pair. Look at all the teeth marks on the arms, can you believe my son ate my glasses?!   He pulled the plastic bits off the arms with his teeth and then hid them around the house. It took me three days to find one arm. [Me, when i found out &gt;&gt; :mad: ]   Oh and never believe the salesman when he says that the fancy glasses with straight arms don't fall off your face. I was niave and these (along with my other pair) were my first glasses. I picked them up and asked &quot;But won't they fall off, I mean they don't appear to grip behind the ears?&quot; So he's like &quot;No, they'll be fine. Try them on and see.&quot;   And sure enough in the shop they stay put. Well, all I can say is that they must have some sort of special magnetic field inside that keeps glassses on people's head because in the 'real' world I've had a couple years worth of catching them as they do their Kamakazi bid and lunge towards the floor.   &quot;Your shoelace is undone!&quot; &quot;Well, I'd gladly tie it but I fear that I might end up picking up bits of glass from the floor if I even look in that direction, so they'll just have to stay undone.&quot;    Bottom Line : People who don't wear glasses should not be allowed to work in a shop that sells glasses because they give BAD advice!     [Rant is over, back to your seats everyone.]"

AbuIlyaas,"My daughter is just five, so I realise fasting isn't incumbent upon her but this morning she absolutely insisted that I let her fast today. So I wrote a note for the teacher and gave her a pack lunch (just in case).  So when I picked her up this evening the first thing I asked her was:  &quot;Are you still fasting?&quot; &quot;Yes!&quot;  &quot;You didn't eat anything?&quot; &quot;I didn't eat  anything - ' cept for my lunch.&quot;  &quot;Well that's not really fasting then, is it?&quot; &quot;Yeah but, I was hungry!&quot;  &quot;But I'm fasting now!&quot;   Ma sha Allah , Kids!"
AbuIlyaas,Excuse the hand writing but it was very cold when I did this and it felt strange writing in Arabic so big.
AbuIlyaas,"Jazaaki Allaahu khairan  for this thread.   I want to try the mangosteen it looks amazing, the leaves on the fruit sort of bulb like. I think I've seen the jakfruit in the various afro-carribean market stalls, it looked like a huge conker shell to me."

AbuIlyaas,"Another option, which I've used many times, is to simply break the musical ability of the toy and let them play with it afterwards.   One way is to poke through the holes in the plastic casing (e.g. under a car you might see a collection of holes in a hexagon shape where the sound comes out) that surround the speaker with a needle or pin, by tearing the paper surround of the speaker it is unable to vibrate and produce any sound.   Or you can unscrew it and cut the wire connecting the battery to the speaker. I did that on an activity set for a baby so that it disabled the annoying &quot;rock-a-bye baby&quot; tune but still allowed the lights to flash when baby kicked its legs.  Drowning toys in a bath tub isn't always a reliable method, as the sound can return when it dries out.   And I took a lot of flak when I cut the head off a teddy bear once, but that's another story."

AbuIlyaas,"al-Salamu `alaikum Shaikhana ,  This forum (as do many others) has a function where you can view &quot;who's online&quot; ( click here to see ). It allows you to see who is currently online and what thread/action they are viewing/doing. As moderators we can see more than regular users, such as those who chose to be 'invisible'.  A question that sometimes occurs to me is, would viewing this facility constitute spying on another Muslim? Such as, clicking it with the intention, &quot;I wonder what Fulan is viewing?&quot;"
AbuIlyaas,"Just a quick note, where I used the word 'you' in that last reply I wasn't meaning  akh  Bey ( hafizhahullaah ) specifically. I was writing in general terms.

I thought to pass it on to any others who'd never heard it.                Wallahi , I miss these two when they used to lecture together.  Insha ' Allah as tonight is the 21st of Ramadan there is a chance that it could be lailat al-Qadr and so I'll use this oppurtunity to ask Allah (' azza wa jall ) that He free our brother Ali from the oppressors that are holding him captive, along with all those who have been unjustly held -  ameen!

AbuIlyaas,"As the questioner hasn't clarified their question I will attempt to do so.  Hookah is a device commonly used in the Middle East and Asia for smoking. Is it permissible for a person to smoke tobacco, or whatever other substance they are smoking, through one of these devices?"
AbuIlyaas,"I think those type of things depend upon the relationship you have with your teacher.  I remember when we had some big project in my English class at school, which involved various writing assignments about a topic. I think it was based around the theme of the aftermath of a nuclear explosion. We were supposed to be writing as survivors or something.   One part of the assignment was to write a poem about all the things that you missed about the pre-nuclear attack period.  So I handed in a piece titled, &quot;A Short but Meaningful Poem.&quot; The text of which was,   &quot;I miss normal life.&quot;  I thought the teacher would start reflecting upon the various levels and meanings to the term 'normal', what it encompassed and how it would vary from person to person.   But she wasn't impressed.  I guess she sussed that I just simply  couldn't  be bothered!  Yeah, but who cares about her anyway? She also told me that a story I wrote about a guy falling out of an aeroplane wasn't funny, so what's she know anyway?"

AbuIlyaas,"There are two issues here, shortening one's  salah  and combining  salah .  The  salawat  that are shortened for a traveller are  zhuhr , ` asr  and ` isha.  These three are ordinarily four  raka'at , but for a traveller they are shortened to two  rakahs .  Maghrib   salah   cannot  be shortened at anytime it is always three  raka'at  irrespective of whether one is travelling or resident.   Maghrib   salah  can, however, be combined for a traveller (and even for the resident when he has a need). However,  maghrib  can  only  be combined with  `isha ; and  zhuhr  can  only  be combined with ` asr;   fajr salah   cannot  be combined with any  salah  it must be prayed in its specified time.  The proof that the resident may combine  salah  when they have some pressing need is in the statement of Ibn Abbas    Quote:    Muslim records from 'Abdullah ibn Shaqiq that 'Abdullah ibn 'Abbas addressed the people one day after the 'asr salah until well after the sun had set and the stars began to appear. The people said to him: &quot;The prayer, the prayer.&quot; A man from the tribe of Taim continuously repeated: &quot;The prayer, the prayer.&quot; Ibn 'Abbas said: &quot;Are you teaching me the sunnah? May you have no mother.&quot; Then he said: &quot;I saw the Messenger of Allah combine the zuhr and 'asr and the maghrib and 'isha.&quot; 'Abdullah ibn Shaqiq commented: &quot;I felt some uneasiness in my heart about what he had said, so I went to Abu Hurairah to ask him about that, and he confirmed what Ibn 'Abbas had said.&quot; [see  fiqh as-sunnah Vol 2, p 118 ]    In cases where the  resident  is combining their  salah  due to some need please note that it is  not  being shortened, it's just being combined. I.e. four  raka'at  of  zhuhr  followed by four  raka'at  of ` asr .  I just wanted to provide this very brief summary of these two issues as people can, at times, get the two (combining and shortening) mixed up and err in their implementation of them.   wa Allahu a'lam ."

AbuIlyaas,"Asslamualykum wa rahmatualllah,  This is not so much a question but a suggestion to the brothers who run this section. MashaAllah it really is a fantastic resource. May Allah preserve the sheikh for his efforts.  My suggestion is however that i think the 'Answered questions' section needs a complete rethink. It seems as though the Sheikh gets many duplicate questions these days re travelling, obeying husband etc. I think its probably that many people are new to this site and its a little unreasonable to expect someone to trawl through 15 pages of answers to get a similar question and also to decipher some of the cryptic titles that people give. Maybe if you could put answered questions into broad categories, marriage, prayer etc. this would help the situation.   I think that in this way the sheikh could focus on answering 'new' questions and not have to keep repeating himself.   Sorry if i have said anything wrong.   wa alykum asslam wa rahmatuallah"

He starts off with a list of 291 names that have variously been attributed to Allah over the years and thereafter whittles the list down to 109 that he argues have authentic proof for them.

If you are looking for a book that discusses the  meanings  of the names then I'd wouldn't recommend the al-Ashqar book.

I can only see 1.5 inches of the far left of my laptop screen (the crack spread) which makes it very,  very  difficult to change the settings of the laptop to display everything on the new screen. When I plugged the new monitor in, it didn't automatically show the laptop desktop, as I'd thought it would.  After a lot random clicking of the mouse in the cracked area, hoping that I'd hit the buttons I needed, I managed to &quot;extend windows to [the new] monitor.&quot;   But this still sucks because the desktop is divided between the two and all the new windows open up in the laptop monitor's side and have to be manually dragged over to the new monitor's side.  So I twiddled with settings a bit more and selected to make the new monitor the primary monitor but when I did that it just went blank and everything shot back to the laptop side.   I can't deselect the laptop monitor's settings from being the primary monitor because that option is always greyed out.  So...   How do I, either:   Set the new monitor to be an exact mirror of what the laptop (but I can't) sees?  Or, how do I set it so the laptop screen is disabled and everything just automatically jumps over to the new screen?  (Please bear in mind that a lot of windows that you might suggest I open up and search through, I won't be able to see because they'll hide under the crack).  Baraka Allahu fikum."

Are you contemplating on murdering him and wanted some form of online approval first? If so, can I strongly suggest that you don't and maybe seek some psychiatric attention.  If you're specifically looking for someone to refute Tibyan articles then there are people who've taken exception to their writings elsewhere on the net. Abuz Zubair from  Islamic Awakening  forums comes to mind.  However, what you essentially did, and why we stepped in, was to come here to ask &quot;Can anyone who holds an extreme/bizarre opinion please identify yourselves and justify it for me&quot; [my words, not yours].  So you can see why we're concerned about the issue of entrapment."

AbuIlyaas,"You might be thinking of a hadith in Muslim and Abu Dawud ( this one ).  Which I found mentioned in  this book.       Quote:    The Messenger (SAW) used to love names which were good in their wording and meaning and he used to hate other names, prohibit them and change them. From these names which the Messenger (SAW) changed was:         慉asiyah (Disobedient) - he changed her name     to Jameelah (Beautiful and Good) (Reported by Muslim &amp; Abu     Dawud)      I think they are different names though, the name mentioned in the hadith with the bad meaning appears to start with an ' ayn  whereas Aasiyah, as in Firaun's wife, starts with  alif .    http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/fundamen....html#031.5966   Perhaps someone could post the Arabic text of these ahadith to confirm this?"

I think it was more a speed thing (just slap it on and leave) than any attempt to protect the environment, plus the Post Office foots the bill for the materials.  One of my friends used to recommend this Dutch paint that was developed at industrial strength for use on drain pipes. The only option is to re-paint as no solvent is going to remove it.  I don't know if this was the case in London, but in the North East there was an ethical [sic] code they abided by. Like you never bought tickets and didn't pay for your paint. So graffiti artists were often in and out of court for fare evasion and shop lifting (not forgetting criminal damage as well). They were also  very  territorial about others' tags appearing their area."
AbuIlyaas,"al-salamu 'alaykum ,  Can anyone explain why my scanner gets moody after it's done a couple of pages and thereafter will only scan little bits of the pages I want it to?  There's no logic to it that I can see, sometimes it just picks a little 10cm square segment in the middle of the page, sometimes it'll only scan half of the page, or it'll ignore the top/bottom 10 cms. I always delete the last image stored, so I can't see how it could be a memory thing  Sometimes a way around it for me is to it switch off and on, or change the settings to something else and then back to what I wanted in the first place. But after a while it cottons on to me doing this and just refuses to scan the whole page until I leave it alone for a couple of days.  I've checked underneath but there's no obvious signs that its female and I'm lost as to an explanation as to why it's so flaming moody!  I have a Canon Pixma MP130.  Can anyone help?"
AbuIlyaas,"Just for reference  here's  a different opinion to the one that brother Qaasim voiced.  What I find difficult to understand in brother Qaasim's words is what made him think that any of us here were the creators of these emoticons. Isn't everyone aware that these images are available all over the internet, what lead him to believe that any of us here &quot;created&quot; them?  If someone offered me a million pounds to state the name of the creator of these emoticons, I doubt I'd be leaving my job to bask in any new found wealth.  I assume that brother Qaasim was making qiyas that the threat of punishment for the image-makers mentioned in the ahadith he cited, by extension applies to all those who display (e.g. host), or cause to be displayed (e.g. select), a non-permanent image created by someone else in a digital format.  Which, to my mind must be a difficult opinion to implement, for surely if one were to go online or to switch on a TV screen, it would only be a matter of seconds before a non-permanent image of something with a soul would appear, caused by the person's action of turning said apparatus on.  Now if someone wanted to argue that these emoticons or moods were somewhat childish, then I'd probably be inclined to agree; but I doubt I'd go as far as calling those who differed with my stance as misguided. But I guess that's just me *shrug*."
AbuIlyaas,"Sorry  akhi , I meant to scan something for you when I got home but then totally forgot and now I'm back at work.    However, in general  sunnah taqriri  is where something happened or was said in front of the Messenger ( sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam ) and he remained silent about it. We know that he was obligated to teach us our religion and correct any misunderstandings we have, so when something happened in his presence and he did not disapprove of, or correct it, then it is taken as having his ( sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam ) tacit approval.     Insha'  Allah, I'll try and dig some examples out when I get home because nothing is coming to mind at the moment."

AbuIlyaas,"Subhana Allah ! Shaykh Suhaib Hasan mentioned that two days ago some people (we would assume because they've heard about the request for money) broke into the  masjid  and used an electric saw attempting to gain access to the safe. The room was apparently filled with bits of the metal-shavings from their &quot;work&quot;.  They then broke into three of the  masjid's  collection boxes and stole the contents, possibly out of frustration at not gaining access to the safe (which he pointed out was empty anyway as the money is kept in the bank).  Shaykh Suhaib requested that if anyone has put a cheque into the donation boxes in the last two weeks to: firstly cancel it at the bank; and, secondly write the  masjid  a new one. He stressed the don't forget to give us a new cheque bit.  Please can everyone make  du'a  that the  masjid  reaches it's target before the due date and that Allah protect them from any further attempt at stealing their funds."

AbuIlyaas,"I had one a couple of weeks ago knock on my door, he must have seen me just walk in, his father was apparently in hospital and he wanted ? to get back to Croydon. So I walked to the shop and bought him a travelcard instead of giving him the money and when I came back to give him the ticket he'd gone.   Someone posted an excellent advice about beggars on hajj on as-Sahwah a long time ago (pre-revamp so it's gone now) which I enjoyed reading."
AbuIlyaas,"The Hanafi position is that three divorces pronounced in one sitting constitutes a final divorce. Whilst it's not the  fiqh  that I follow, I do recognise that it's a position that many ` ulama ' took. I personally follow the opinion that Ibn Taymiyyah is famous for, that such would constitute a single divorce.  In terms of the news report, I don't find it that unusual that someone took three pronouncements as being a final divorce (although I do disagree with this position). The most glaring error in this story, to my mind, is holding someone not in control of their actions (asleep) accountable.

I'm just making the point that to make a film people frequently go beyond the realms of possibility to get the audience's attention and the &quot;defeating multiple opponents&quot; is a hot bed for this kind of thing.    However, I did like some of the scenes in the recent film Ong Bak. Some healthy usage of elbows :D And the guy fighting whilst his legs were on fire was spectacular.   There was a beautiful TKO in a recent UFC. Someone (haven't got the DVD in front of me) got caught with a spinning back kick to the ribs which really injured him, it looked like he'd broke some ribs and was in a lot of pain. He couldn't even keep his hands up to defend himself. Then his opponent took advantage of the situation and lunged at him with a flying knee to the jaw and then ref stepped in and stopped the fight.

AbuIlyaas,"al-Salamu 'alaykum ,  After much deliberation we have decided to  withdraw   the facility for &quot;unregistered&quot; users to put questions to the Shaykh. From now on if anyone wishes to ask a question they must be registered and have opened an account on this forum.  We have opted to do this for a number of reasons:  1)The Messenger of Allah ( Salla Allahu 'alayhi wa sallam ) was never asked anonymously. Sometimes people would ask on behalf of other people but not anonymously. So in that sense it's against the Sunnah.   2) There may be times when we need to contact a questioner privately and being able send a private message to their account, or having an email address that they registered to the site with, will help us on the rare occassions when we need to contact someone.  3) We hope that by requiring people to register that the service will be taken more seriously. As there have been some instances (not many and some that were deleted) where the comment or question posted has left us wondering if the person is being serious or is attempting to have a joke at our expense. Please remember in Islam we don't need to ask questions just for the sake of asking. Islam doesn't enjoin upon us that we wear certain colours of shoes or how many cups of water we should drink in a day.   4) We noticed that some unregistered questioners were submitting as a many as ten questions in one go. We hope that now people are registered it will be more obvious when a person does this. And that it will make questioners more aware and considerate of others who are also waiting to have their questions answered by the Shaykh .  Lastly, I would like to stress that registering does not mean that we will reveal your identity. People are still free to register with a non-descriptive user name. It just that by having everyone as 'registered' it allows us to better manage the &quot;Ask the Scholar&quot; section."

Is a Muslim woman allowed to get her navel pierced for adornment?     Answer   Answered by: Sheikh `Abd al-Wahh鈈 al-Turayr?  This would be permissible, especially if it is considered acceptable adornment by people in your region of the world as long as there is no ensuing harm on the body. This takes the same ruling that piercing the nose or ear takes in other countries.    Muhammad al-Shareef made the following comment:     Quote:    I believe you [ answering the sister's question  here  ] got some comments on another folder [ this thread ] regarding this issue (and the difference of opinion).    From an Usool Alfiqh point of view, wearing this type of ring if it's in a culture that thinks it looks alright, that it's not mutilation, and that the woman is wearing it in front of her husband, then in sha Allah it's alright.    However, this type of ring I am guessing is becoming popular because of non-Muslim women; that this young sister is asking because of non-Muslim influence. If that's the case, I would recommend that she not follow in their footsteps and seek out ways in which she may beautify herself that do not follow the footsteps of those who are not out to please Allah.      wAllahu 'alam."
AbuIlyaas,"al-Salamu 'alaykum,  Is there anyway that a person can get the software needed to unlock a mobile that's been network restricted themselves?  I bought a phone in the UK and was given a quote of ?0 to make it GSM (i.e. it would accept sims from all networks). I figured that was way too much and that someone in Saudi would be able to do it cheaper for me and didn't bother getting the phone unlocked before I left.   However, now I'm getting told that they can't unblock it from here because it was an UK network that had restricted the handset.  Is there no way of just downloading the software from somewhere and having a tinker around inside the phone myself?  I'm looking for the software for SonyEricsson W810i."
AbuIlyaas,"Sas,  Please could you write a &quot;recent comments plug-in&quot; for puglu? Like the ones they have on WordPress where the last five comments and comment-ers are listed on the top of the front page."
AbuIlyaas,"I misread an article from the  BBC Website  and it started a debate about what irony is. This is how I misread the article:     Quote:    Mr Bush dismissed Zawahri as &quot;dark, dim and backwards&quot;    Which I maintained was ironic because if I were to write a list of names of people I found &quot;dark, dim and backwards&quot; he'd  way  up there.   So we dipped into the dictionary and I argued that it is irony under the third definition. &quot; 3.  incongruity between what is expected to be and what actually is, or a situation or result showing such incongruity&quot;   But my colleague maintained that it would only have been ironic if George Bush had said it sarcastically, whilst being fully aware that he was himself &quot;dark, dim and backwards.&quot; And cited the first definition of &quot; 1.  the humorous or mildly sarcastic use of words to imply the opposite of what they normally mean.&quot;   Can anyone settle this debate for me?"
AbuIlyaas,"How was she able to determine if it was a man snake or not? Or, are Hindus allowed to marry female snakes as well?"
AbuIlyaas,"Plus the smiley thing still seems to happen when people cut'n'paste Arabic into a post here. Stray  ,   &amp;  s suddenly appear where they weren't before."
AbuIlyaas,My guess is that it's a biscuit crumb problem as a stray crumb can cause havoc. I suspect there's one hiding under the 'h' key at work. I was thinking about pulling it off to investigate but I'm not sure how easily it'll fit back on and don't want to get in trouble. So if I ever make a post on the board where I refer to something being &quot; hhhhhharam &quot; you now know why.
AbuIlyaas,I'm waiting for:      Woman Makes Handbag from Dead Husband's Corpse.     or      World Consensus: Stupid Hindu Needs Slap .
AbuIlyaas,"Yeah, it's all working now  maa shaa' Allaah .  Baaraka Allaahu feekum ."
AbuIlyaas,"I'm  not  saying that Prof doesn't read but when I saw his post here it reminded me of the scene in the film Ghostbusters where the secretary is trying to chat up Egon Spengler, as he works on his computer.      Quote:     Janine Melnitz:  I bet you like to read a lot, too.   Dr Egon Spengler:  Print is dead!   Janine Melnitz:  Oh, that's very interesting to me, I read a lot myself. Some people think I'm too intellectual but I think it's a fabulous way to spend your spare time. I also play racketball. Do you have any hobbies?   Dr Egon Spengler:  I collect spores, moulds and fungus."
AbuIlyaas,Please also refer to the answer the Shaykh gave in this thread:     Making dua in sajda and in languages other than Arabic
AbuIlyaas,"Can I just post a general reminder to us all that it is possible for us to disagree and argue our cases without injecting harshness into our words.   Let us reflect upon the words of the Messenger ( salla Allahu 'alayhi wa sallam ) when he said:  &quot;Indeed gentleness does not enter into anything except it beautifies it, nor is it removed from anything except that it disfigures it.&quot; (Muslim)  Let us take an advice from Imam Shafi'i ( rahimahu Allah ) when he said &quot;I believe my opinion is right with the possibility that it is wrong and I believe the opinion of those who disagree with me is wrong with the possibility that it is right&quot;  Regarding the topic of debate itself then to my mind there's no specific pattern. I've met both &quot;reverts&quot; and &quot;born Muslims&quot; who have shortcomings, or are outwardly excelling, in their  deen . Allahu a'lam.  I think one point that can mold a person's perception though is that non-practicing reverts are less visible than non-practicing born Muslims, as the latter tends to be more identifiable due to things like their nationality.   So a revert who has accepted Islam and has been lazy with it tends to pass unnoticed amongst the masses unless you have some specific reason to know that they're Muslim. So it'd be easy to see &quot;practicing&quot; reverts and conclude that &quot;they&quot; as a group are more &quot;in to&quot; their  deen  than their &quot;born into&quot; counterparts.  Wa Allahu a'lam .  Feel free to disagree."
AbuIlyaas,"wa 'alaykum,  If you email me at abuilyaas[at]islamicnetwork.com I can forward something on for you."
AbuIlyaas,is hookah haram?
AbuIlyaas,"I don't understand, I just tried and it opened fine.  Other than that, there should still be a couple of days left on this YSI link:   http://s64.yousendit.com/d.aspx?id=1XKF8FBUB6OJU3J8AGRQUB4IPG   UponSunnah also have it uploaded:    http://www.uponsunnah.com/brohus/Ghu...%20Ghuraba.pdf   But they are all from the same source, so if you are finding problems here they may also be present in these links."
AbuIlyaas,"I took my daughter to the supermarket with me, as kids often are, she was determined to get items of her choice into the trolley.   &quot;Daddy, Mummy said she'd buy this for me [ I doubt it ] but she never did!&quot;   I looked at what she was pointing, &quot;Timotei Age Defying Shampoo.&quot;   &quot;Err... you're only six years old, I don't think you really need that yet!&quot;"
AbuIlyaas,"I've got a 'rep' question.    How many people do I have to 'rep' before I can 're-rep' a person that I've previously 'rep-ed'?   Because,  Qadar Allaah,  I always seem to come across situations where I want to 're-rep' someone shortly after I've 'rep-ed' them. I guess some people are just 'on a roll' after making a good post.   ... and if it is possible, I'd like the amount of people you need to rep before 're-repping' reduced so that I don't keep getting &quot; You must spread some Reputation around before giving it to Fulaan again &quot; messages.    Jazaakum Allaahu khairan."
AbuIlyaas,.
AbuIlyaas,"Quote:     Despite the Koranic emphasis on the fundamentally human nature of Mohammed, the  hagiographic  tradition continues to dominate perceptions of the Prophet.      My dictionary is at home, who's going to help me out with this one?"
AbuIlyaas,"Actually its still happening. I've just noticed that everytime I switch the PC off it reverts back to having dial up as the connection preference.  I changed, applied and okayed the internet options to not use dial up (and all other windows were closed at the time) but everytime I switch off it's like I didn't do anything.  Any advice?  Here's what I see when I go the control panel at switch on:"
AbuIlyaas,Eurgh! Look how it messes with the formatting here.   http://talk.islamicnetwork.com/forumdisplay.php?f=11
AbuIlyaas,"Quote:     Originally Posted by  sasjamal   You have them beong moderated.. Its an option, just choose to UNMODERATE THEM...     I can't find where/how to switch 'moderate' off."
AbuIlyaas,"Actually, the coffee is starting to kick in, I think I get it now."
AbuIlyaas,It never ceases to amaze me how evil the Israeli propaganda machine is.
AbuIlyaas,"This needs acting on. We've another 10 spams sitting in the comments section, for things like poker, etc."
AbuIlyaas,This was our course text when I did the  tajweed  module:   http://www.simplyislam.com/1268.html   It uses cassettes so I don't know if it'll fit in with what you're planning though.  I preferred it over the Umm Muhammad book.
AbuIlyaas,"Bro Hus, I don't know why but I'd always thought you were in the U.S., I guess not."
AbuIlyaas,"wa 'alaykum salam,  The alternative to Kamali's book would be the Nyazee book but Kamali is still more detailed. I've uploaded Nyazee's book in the second post in  this thread . The published book (i.e. not the online version) is slightly different, they took out the section on business and expanded on the other sections.  Other than that then Ahmad Hasan has a book on Qiyas called, &quot;Analogical Reasoning in Islamic Jurisprudence: A Study of the Juridical Principle of Qiyas&quot;. However, in all honesty the book is hard to get and by the time you track it down, have it delivered and then actually read it you'll most likely be  way  past your submission deadline. I found it available for purchase online  here .  Insha' Allah, Kamali should be enough to write a paper in English on the subject and by using Nyazee as extra reading you'll be able to add a couple of points or quotes that Kamali didn't cover. That's what I did when did the  usul  modules with LOC."
AbuIlyaas,"Akhi Ibn al-Hyderabadee, I've deleted your above post because I find it inappropriate that you are calling moderators names (the numeric twist) when you are taking issue with decisions like that.  It's fine to ask that question and please feel free to do so again, but minus the name calling, baraka Allahu fikum."
AbuIlyaas,More details on the prank phone call please.
AbuIlyaas,I used to call my old one  %$**#&quot;.    I'll see how this one behaves before I think of a name for it.
AbuIlyaas,This is old but I remembered it today because I was talking about it with someone  .  It's a salary review that I was sent three years ago (power point presentation).
AbuIlyaas,Here's his site:   http://www.arabicforeveryone.com/
AbuIlyaas,"The matter is being looked at, insha' Allah."
AbuIlyaas,Shaykh Isam has answered some questions on leasing that may also be of interest:   http://talk.islamicnetwork.com/showthread.php?t=5767   http://talk.islamicnetwork.com/showthread.php?t=10150
AbuIlyaas,"I think a transitional moment in my life was at university and living away from home; I started to notice that if I left my dirty socks on the floor and went to class, when I returned they'd still be there! :huh: So I'd go for a point in time where you start to realise/comprehend what your parents do/did for you."
AbuIlyaas,"Often when I choose to preview a reply before submitting it, I get extra blank lines added or blank lines missed out. Especially if I have cut'n'paste the text in from a word document.    I end up having to keep correcting the format each time I opt to preview. I use the WYSIWYG settings on the site but  W hat  I   S ee  I s  D ifferent  F rom  W hat  I   G et when I hit 'preview' (sometimes).    Any ideas?"
AbuIlyaas,"Another suggestion: I come across a lot of atheists, so you could use an ayaah that refutes that.     And they say, &quot;There is not but our worldly life; we die and live, and nothing destroys us except time.&quot; And they have of that no knowledge; they are only assuming.   (al-Jaathiyah 45:24)"
AbuIlyaas,Does it make your intention for you too?
AbuIlyaas,"al-salamu 'alaykum ,   When someone is making  qunut  in  witr  should they still try to look at the point on the floor that they'll prostrate on, because I find I tend to look at my outstretched palms when I'm making  qunut ?"
AbuIlyaas,"Quote:     Originally Posted by  Editor   You could actually use that and ask (in 'nicer' terms) What is Jordan doing in light of the Palestinian's plight? Yes, a rhyme might be nice.

Quote him on the issue and ask for clarification, elaboration, etc.     You'll probably get some wishy-washy answer that includes some numerical figure that they've given in aid in recent years. Isn't there some kind of restriction on what types of jobs Palestinian refugees can hold in Jordan and it's ludicrously difficult to get permission to get building materials into camps there just to make elementary repairs to &quot;homes&quot;?   How's about &quot;Would Sharon's death make you happy or sad?&quot;"

AbuIlyaas,"Shaykh, you mentioned the aspect of forgiveness for not being aware of the prohibition.  But what about a sister who had done the above intending these fasts to make up for her missed days during Ramadan, would these fasts be accepted (due to her ignorance) and count towards her outstanding days, or would she have to fast again?"

But as separate issue, we'd need to understand that we couldn't make something ourselves and include alcohol as an ingredient.

The first husband is secluded with the wife but does not consumate the marriage, then he divorces her, and so according to one opinion she is entitled to keep the whole  mahr .  The second husband divorces her without being in seclusion with her or consumating the marriage with her and so she is entitled to half of the  mahr .

AbuIlyaas,"I really like the header (the white, blue &amp; green combo.), I think it'd look good on a T-Shirt."
AbuIlyaas,"I'm big on emphasising to them to tell the truth. So sometimes I'll purposefully let them off with something that they've done which is naughty if they own up to it when I ask. I'll praise them for having told me the truth to drive the point home, mind you, that depends on what they've done! ( How do you stop kids from drawing on walls by the way?)    Was it George Washington that there is a story about him cutting down his father's apple tree, the moral of which was to tell the truth?   A story which I misunderstood as a child: After coming home with a hole in the knee of my new trousers, my Dad complained to me about it - something about thinking he was made of money. So, as someone who'd been told this tree story at school and in an effort to implement this frank and open honesty I'd heard about, I told my Dad, &quot;at least they lasted longer than my last pair!&quot; My Dad went nuts"
AbuIlyaas,"I think the two primary objections that are cited by those who deem it as impermissible would be:    (1) That there is a harm to the body in it.   (2) That it is imitation of the kuffar.   This may vary in application dependent upon the part of the body that someone is wanting pierced.   The second one will in part relate to the  'urf  (custom) of the people that someone is amongst. Is the particular type of piercing unique to the kuffar or is it found amongst everyone. I can see that something like having a pierced nose (provided it's not the bull look) is common place amongst many people in the West and not restricted to just non-Muslims.   The piercing of the navel  could  (I suppose) be approaching that in terms of universality amongst people but you've got to wonder whether the first Muslims who did this were imitating the kuffar or not, even if those who do it now argue that today it's universal. But I still don't personally like it as a form of adornment.   When it comes to other body areas I really doubt that someone could suggest that they are not copying the non-Muslims when they do it. Plus I just don't  get  why anyone would want to.    Like Ibn El-Sheikh mentioned the tool shed face look, I just can't understand the attraction in that. The one where they pierce just above one side of the mouth with a stud, it just looks to me like a spot. People in general hate when they get spots on their face but somehow this look is supposed to be attractive - bizarre! I suppose to kill two birds with one stone next time one of them gets a spot they could just glue a bit of tin foil on top to hide it and pretend it's fashion."
AbuIlyaas,"Propose a new title and if Ibn al-Hyderabadee agrees I'll change it, insha' Allah."
AbuIlyaas,"Shaykh, someone is asking:  If a sister holds that it is permissible for a woman to have her face and hands exposed (i.e. that  niqab  is  mustahab  not  wajib ) and she lives amongst a people where it is customary for women to pierce their nose, is she restricted to wearing her nose ring in front of her husband and those males who are  mahram  for her, or may she wear it when she is outside in front of other males?"
AbuIlyaas,"I don't understand what you could be getting at here. If the Messenger ( sallallahu 'alaihi wa sallam ) warned against extremism in religion then surely extremism is considered to exist. Or, are you arguing a linguistic point and saying that if it is extremism the it's not Islam?  &quot;How fine are like this size. Beware of going beyond the bounds of the religion. The people before you were destroyed by going to extremes in the religion.&quot; (Ahmad, ibn Khuzaimah, al-Nasa'i and ibn Majah. Declared sahih by al-Hakim, al-Dhahabi, ibn Taymiyyah and al-Nawawi)  Ibn Taymiyyah said,   Quote:    &quot;This [instruction] is general for all forms of extremism in matters of beliefs or deeds. The cause behind that general statement, the throwing of the pebbles, is included in the prohibition, such as throwing larger stones on the basis that they are greater than smaller ones. Then he explained it in such a way that means that one must avoid following their way [lit., guidance], that is, the way of the people before us, as a means of distancing us from what destroyed them. The one who joins with them by acting in a similar fashion to their behaviour must fear destruction for himself.&quot;    I took this from  Religious Extremism, by Dr. Abdul Rahmaan ibn Mualaa al-Luwaihiq al-Mutairi  (trans. Jamal Zarabozo p.72)"

AbuIlyaas,"al-salamu 'alaykum ,  I have to go to Southall later today, insha' Allah. I'm not sure if I will pray jumu'ah before I get there or not. If I'm there around jumu'ah time, where should I pray as I don't know the area at all? Preferably with directions on foot from the national rail station."
AbuIlyaas,"I think it'll depend where you go. They had a couple of East African Shuyukh visiting in the Wakefield Avenue da'wah centre (Abu Hanifah's old place) some years back and they were very strong in the deen, masha' Allah!   We heard a lot of good things about the da'wah over there, strong pockets of practing Muslims. There was one Shaykh called Abu Hamza and the other one I forgot his name but I think his centre was in Tanzania anyway.  But you still need to take into the culture shock factor too, although she'll find the adhan called openly and other Islamic aspects more visible in Kenya, the difference in the customs and interactions with the people might be different to what a sister raised in the Uk is used to. Not saying that things are unIslamic but just in day to day life, things might be done slower, differently, or less well organised for example. Long term that might get to someone and put a strain on the relationship.   It's true that someone should have their sight set on deeni motivations but it's surprising how, often with time, other factors can come into play and a person may feel unhappy for something they'd have considered trivial before having entered into marriage.  It depends on how much the two are considering each other as viable spouses. Another option might be for the sister to say that she'd like to take a three week &quot;holiday&quot; with her mahram in the area that they &quot;might&quot; one day stay visit to interact with the brother and his family (in a halal way) over there. Maybe offer to split the costs between the two parties for the sister and her mahram to travel there.   Be honest that it's a concern to the sister moving to a new country and express that otherwise the brother is acceptable proposal, but she'd just like to get a realistic feel for the area prior to making a commitment like marriage.  Allahu a'lam"
AbuIlyaas,"Do something on &quot;Is orthodox is Islam represented in the British media?&quot;  Then you could define how we ascertain what is orthodoxy in Islam. Discuss how minority and fringe elements are presented by the media as representative of British Muslims. Highlight some organisations in particular that purport to, but according the definition you've reached do not, represent orthodox Islam in the media.  You go on to discuss the media clowns like Yasmin Ali-Bhai, or ethnical orientated community leaders who stand and spout nonsense about Islam. Report on how British media prefers sensationalism over accuracy and they'd much rather put a loud mouth in front of the camera than someone who'll speak eloquently.  Don't know, I think there'd be loads of scope here and it could be something beneficial as a reference point for others."

AbuIlyaas,"You shouldn't have deleted that bit, it let us know what capabilities admin and mods have, which is useful because sometimes you re-read something and think has this changed or am I mad?   We didn抰 cover 1984 in our English class at school and I didn't take English very far. It took me a long time to get around to reading it. I really enjoyed it, with the exclusion of the  zinaa  part of the story line. I nearly gave it back to person who lent it to me because I was like, if this is just one long love story you can have it back? He responded 搕rust me it gets better.?  As far as the language goes it is an interesting observation that thought control can be introduced through stemming vocabulary, restricting or stream-lining language as means to temper discontent. I still find it difficult to comprehend that it was written when it was.   On the whole I thought the book was more of a proposition than a prediction. I wouldn抰 mind reading a study guide of the book, anyone recommend a book of  sharh  of 1984?"

AbuIlyaas,"You could always try the &quot;lead by example&quot; approach and arrive 20 minutes late yourself and then address the crowd with &quot;You see! How do you like it? You don't -  do you ?&quot; then just walk out having proven your point.  Other than that the only hadith that is coming to mind right now is one in  Abu Dawud (here)  where the Messenger of Allah ( Salla Allahu 'alayhi wa sallam ) waited three days for a man he'd arranged to meet and who didn't turn up. This was before the prohethood. I don't know how good the translation on MSA-USC is of that, but the incident seemed gentler in the  sirah  book I recalled it from.    Quote:    &quot;He [the Messenger ( salla Allahu 'alayhi wa sallam )] was so much particular with his word of promise that once he waited for three days at the street corner for a person 'Abdullah bin Abi-al-Hinsa, who promised to be back there in a short time. When the person passed that way on the fourth day the Holy Prophet ( salla Allahu 'alayhi wa sallam ) was not annoyed, instead he said, &quot;I am here for three days to keep my word.&quot; The man felt sorry for that and realised his mistake.&quot;  (Muhammad the Final Messenger - Majid Ali Khan p.62)"
AbuIlyaas,"al-Salamu 'alaykum,  I'm just a bit curious and wanted to ask the numerous bloggers out there, how much spam comments do you get in a day on your blogs?  I seem to be getting between 10 and 50 spam comments every day in the moderating queue and that's not including the comments that get automatically deleted because they contain certain prohibited keywords.  My automatically-delete-when-these-words-appear list currently contains 49 words; ranging from the usual pornographic terms to an almost complete pharmaceutical inventory.  I'm just curious as to how badly others are affected by these numbskulls."
AbuIlyaas,"Salamualkum, brother Isam. I just wanted to ask you about a dream. I had this dream in where eveything was back but there were alot of supernatural beings, i guess outlined in blue ( Everything is black, even them , however they are distunguished by this blue line they are outlined with). In the dream, i knew they were either jinns or soemthing supernatural. Another thing is that whenever i close my eyes, i get like light behing my eyes (it is not from looking at the light then closing my eyes). Like a day ago, i closed my eys to go to sleep, and thelights were off, but then i got like white sparks or fireworks and it scared me so i opened my eyes and it happened again. Dies this have a meaning??? jazaullahu Khairan"
AbuIlyaas,"I have a friend who is a plumber and a Muslim.   He related to me, that once when he was installing a washing machine in the home of a Muslim family he was explaining to the 'man of the house' how it works.      &quot;Select the type of wash you want. You press this button for ...&quot;      He was interrupted , &quot;What are you telling me for ?  [ points over his shoulder towards his wife ]  - tell her!&quot;      This seems such an inter-community issue that someone has come up with  a solution.    There is a related issue to this; whether doing housework is an obligation upon the wife or whether it is something recommended and commendable. Scholars have differed over this point and I have linked/attached two discussions in English about it, where different conclusions are reached:   Sheikh Salih al-Munajjids discusses  it here  Sheikh Jamal al-Din Zarabozo discusses it in the attached word doc.   But, putting aside whether or not one thinks that this is an obligation upon the wife, and my intention behind raising this issue in the thread -    Couldn't we all do a little bit more to help out around the house?  (this is firstly an online advice to myself, to try and improve)   This would include those of us living at home with our parents, as housework needs doing there too.      Quote:     Narrated Al-aswad   That he asked 'Aisha &quot;What did the Prophet use to do in his house?&quot; She replied, &quot;He used to keep himself busy serving his family and when it was the time for prayer he would go for it.&quot;     Bukhaaree, Volume 1, Book 11, Number 644."

Do i make a prayer in each of the garments or do i pray without any garments at all? I used this to make an analogy with the situation with 2 vessels of water, one being pure and the other not, not knowing which to be which.   anyways, after checking, my analogy was wrong. So as stated before the correct answer is to just make tayammum.     The example you gave here about the two garments, is this something that you've read before? I mean have you come across a discussion on this and someone gave this ruling?   I thought it strange that someone would be asked to make the  salaah  twice when there is an instruction, &quot;Do not pray the same  salah  twice in one day&quot; (which is mentioned in  fiqh al-sunnah  2.59, although where the statement is collected/found isn't cited.)"

AbuIlyaas,"al-Salamu 'alaykum,  To anyone teaching or having taught at primary school level, what fonts do you use when preparing handwriting worksheets?  I'm looking for a good one for manuscript (as opposed to cursive) handwriting.  At the moment I tend to use  Avian  because the a's look like real a's. But the middle sized letters often vary in size and I'd like something better. For example, the bar on the capital A sits lower down than the top of a lower case letter, when ideally I'd like them at the same height for handwriting practice.   Comic Sans MS  is a bit erratic in letter height and whilst the a's are like real a's the variant letter size puts me off using it.  So what font do you use (manuscript or cursive)?"

AbuIlyaas,"al-salamu 'alaykum  Shaykh,    I have a question,  insha ' Allah.

There is a similar hadith collected in Abu Dawud, where the Messenger of Allah ( Salla Allahu 'alayhi wa sallam ) said:      Quote:    &quot;If you hear the barking of dogs, and the braying of donkeys at night then solicit Allah's protection from them, for they see what you do not.&quot;       Al-Albani said that it was sound due to its channels  sahih bituruqih.  He included it in the work S ahih al-kalimu al-tayyib.     The second hadith doesn't explicitly say that the donkey or dog has seen a  shaytan , just that &quot;they see what we see not&quot;, but are we allowed to put the two hadith together and say that what the second hadith means is that both these animals can see  shayatin ?"

So it suddenly sorts my inbox into alphabetical subject title order. It's normally not a problem because I then go to the far right (insert Swatzika here) of the bar and click on 'date' and I'm back to how I like it, emails sorted by when I got them.   But, I don't know what I've done this time but the 'date' bit on the bar has disappeared and so I can't press it.

I mentioned this to a trainer on a 'workplace violence awareness' seminar - he wasn't very impressed, but hey! it beats swearing back at 'em right?

AbuIlyaas,"The story goes (' an  'AbdulHakim Murad) there was this &quot;wali&quot; who was a goldsmith and he was busy tapping away on some gold with his hammer.

I suspect that these will have come into the language as Christians attempted to avoid &quot;taking  their  lord's name in vein&quot;. They'd start an exclamation intending Jesus, fear that they were taking their lord's name in vein and invariably short-trip it, or detour to a phrases like &quot; geez !&quot; Then after time the phrase itself will take on an identity, with dictionary references citing - slang, of unknown origin.   Similar to how some people end up saying &quot;sugar!&quot; when they find themself's en-route to a certain swear word.   ( note: this is speculation on my part, I'm not a linguist )"
AbuIlyaas,"I really liked this recipe for Shurba that came via an Algerian relative. (Some of the spelling will likely be off here)  Boneless lamb chunks fried with onions and garlic. Only brown it a little and add some ground pepper and about a level table spoon of paprika. Add a small tin of tomato puree. Once that's good and mixed up, add enough water to take it up to a soup level. Once it's simmering add some chopped celery. I think simmer for about 40 mins. The last ingredient is some broken verimicilli (pasta) once that becomes soft it's ready. I was told that rather than verimicilli you can also use broken bulgar wheat (which I think was called freak by Algerians?)"

There's a lot of pain involved in training plus the inevitability of injury but that would be true of a lot of other sports as well. There are some specific injuries that are associated with Muay Thai.   But your body not recognising when it is sick, like with flu, etc - then I haven't heard this before but I'm not an expert, perhaps post it as a question on an MMA forum.  I would also recommend Brazilian JuJitsu as one of the better grappling arts. But just wanted to point out that people sometimes confuse Brazilian Jujitsu with Vale Tudo and get surprised or disappointed when they attend class and find themselves constantly grappling, wearing a gi, etc. Some clubs will teach Vale Tudo applications of BJJ and if that's what you're after then check before hand if they do it. Sometimes people can feel let down when they attend class and find sports BJJ different to what they'd expected from watching UFC/Pride etc."

I don't recollect fiddling with any of my own user settings to make it so. There is obviously a benefit in having it set to from  'the beginning'  as a newcomer will see more than just two threads, without having to make the  effort  themselves. As some of us are a little miserly when it comes to our  effort  (read: lazy).   Didn't it  used  to be like that anyway? :huh: Just a suggestion."
AbuIlyaas,We used to have PMs here which were restricted to only allowing people of the same gender to contact each other privately. We set it up this way in order to follow Islamic guidelines on the interaction of the genders.  When we upgraded the forums to a more advanced version last year we lost the particular hack that allowed us to restrict the function in this manner. So we've just kept it switched off until such time as we can re-install the hack.

That sounds very close to where I was staying when I went for  'umrah  during Ramadan. When you got the bus taking you to and from the haram, was the stop/area known as Mahbas al-jinn?  I went to that Bin Dawud's and bought a huge crate of small mango juice bottles. Then when I was at the till the guy beckoned someone over to carry it to my car for me. I had a hard time trying to explain to him that I didn't have a car, as he didn't seem to understand why someone would be buying this much juice when they're just walking home. I kind of waved my arms a bit and said &quot; ma 'indy saiyarah !&quot; Not sure if that's correct but he eventually shrugged and gave me my crate back.  The international call shop was on the other side of the road from bin Dawud's and I felt like I was taking my life into my hands (figuratively) everytime I crossed it, as people tend to drive like they're filming a high speed car chase from Lethal Weapon or something. I saw maybe 3 or 4 accidents during the 10 days I was there.  I saw one youth on a bicycle get hit by a car, the driver stopped and the boy just dusted himself off said &quot; ma fihi mushkil &quot; and cycled off again, bizarre!  The building I was in was a private residence, a block of flats, but they rent it out during hajj. There was a dry cleaner's underneath to help me remove the mango juice stains from my thobe."

AbuIlyaas,et voila!
AbuIlyaas,"In brief, Kate Fox outlines that the words a person uses are indicators of their class. Different classes amongst the English will tend to cluster around certain words. In the extract that I will shortly post she made certain assertions about the words we discussed being indicative of particular classes.   Her work is very witty and astute but it is also a genuine social anthropological look at what makes the English, English. So my first reaction when I read this was that she might have made some wry observations but in terms of language indicating one's class, I didn't feel that the examples she gave were particularly accurate indicators.    She has written this section of her book as a list of seven words that will be looked down upon by someone who is upper class, when they are spoken in his presence. In terms of that then she may well be very accurate, however within the explanations for each word she makes assertions that alternatives belong to particular classes. It was through observing that I seemed to range in my own classification from working all the way up to upper class, that lead me to speculate that she was slightly off in her assessment of this distribution.    And so I reworded the extract from her book to satsisfy my mental curiosity, I felt that others would similarly find themselves cast into multiple classes by their answers and hence that her assessment was, whilst very funny, slightly inaccurate.   Anyway,  jazakum Allahu khayran  for all of your input."

Like for instance, if there was a case where a married person had been seen (by four reliable witnesses) to have commited zina and this was brought before a Qadi who stated that this specific person should be stoned to death, would you be up in arms about such a punishment being applied?"

I've often heard the hadith quoted but the thing is, I've never actually read an explanation of it. So when I looked at the hadith myself, what made me say what I said was that it appears in the command form (imperative), which would suggest that us ordering them is obligatory, in the absence of evidence to restrict that. Plus the &quot;to pray&quot; appears general and so I had assumed it would naturally include all prayers, as does our command &quot;to pray&quot;. I realised there was a dispensation which meant that there is no beating until the age of ten, so the approach I had intended to take was to order them to pray each  salah  from seven but not to discipline them if the failed in that until they reached ten, when I'd be more adamant that they fulfil this.   I'm just explaining that's how I'd initially looked at it, not saying that I'm right or anything, as I confess I haven't read any explanation of this hadith. But having now read how you'd taken the command (which certainly would make things easier) I hope to look more into the issue, insha' Allah. Jazakum Allahu khayran for your post.

Isam Rajab,"Is it true that on the Day Of Judgement, Allah will send a Prophet to four types of people:  children, mentally retarded (who didnt understand the message), the deaf (who couldnt hear the message) and the people who came in between prophets and didnt get the message. And then, depending on if they follow the Prophet, they will enter Heaven or Hell?   Does this mean that children dont automatically go to Jannah and they could potentially enter the Hellfire? And if this hadith is authentic, how will children be able to follow anyone on the Day of Jugement...wont they still have the mental limitations of children or will they mature? Same question for the retarded. Also, do we know who this Prophet is that will test them?  Im a little confused about this because I always understood that a child is not responsible before he reaches the age of puberty and goes straight to Heaven but this hadith implies that he will be accountable.   If you could explain, please. Jazak Allah"
Isam Rajab,I don't know.
Isam Rajab,"when a baby is born in US hospitals, many hospitals do not use &quot;flowing&quot; water to wash the baby completely. part of the reason is that for the first several hours after birth, maintaining the baby's body temperature is extremely important (ie they also keep the baby under heated lamps for some time, etc) (maybe this has to do with infection and death rates). i have seen some nurses who &quot;wash&quot; the newborn from the filth that it is covered in from the birth. they often just use a lotion or soap-like material and rub it on the baby and wipe it off, maybe with some water. i think they actually do wash the hair with flowing water at times.   after this time, they advise parents to keep the umbilical cord (belly button area) dry until the cord falls off in a week or so. they tell them that they shouldnt submerge the baby in water, but rather, they should just wipe the baby with wet cloth to clean it for its &quot;bath&quot;  my question is this: to remove the birth impurities, must water be flowed on the baby? can one just wet a towel and wipe it off a few times and then consider the filth to be gone?  does this mean that the baby is essentially covered with impurities until the parents can take the child home and clean it properly? im asking because it will have consequences on the people who will come and visit in the hospital and kiss/hold the baby as well as on the parents who would have to be careful of not touching the impurities and then touching other things in their home."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   This money is owned by the government. You only have the right to use it as advised, that's why they call it &quot;Child Tax&quot;. So let's say the government knew that you're not paying it for the child's help but for your own things, would they allow it? I don't think so, so if that's the case then you're supposed to spend this money on the child's things.   In America there's something similar called (WIC) which is a check for food has no cash value and you can only get specific types of food with it.   So I believe your husband is correct. This money is not to purchase pizza and so (Unless the baby eats pizza) but to purchase things he needs."
Isam Rajab,"Wa'laikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   In your case you count months instead of periods."

Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I advise you to have wisdom, which means if you told your husband would that solve the problem or it'll be aggrivated instead? If you believe it'll solve the problem then it's ok to tell him if you know he's able to correct the situation. I have to admit that it's difficult to deal with in-laws on day to day basis but that doesn't mean it's impossible. Try to build a way of communication by having few minutes talk every day or some activities which involve both of you. Usually people like to be given credit for what they do so if you praise her how she raised her son this will help a lot."

And her friend said that people can't born with homosexual because Allah dislike homosexual then how come poeple born homosexual.  Now my sister is confused about homosexual that can poeple born homosexual? oir its just they born normal and then choose this way (homosexual way).    Asalam o alikum"

Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If It's a new thing in the religion and the need of it was existing at the time of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam yet he didn't do it then it's bida', if not then it's not Bida'. So, if it's not from the religion you can't say it's bida'. And if it's from the religion yet it wasn't needed at the time of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam then you still can't call it Bida'. An example for this is the lines of the rows in prayer. They were not existed at the time of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam but he used to straighten the lines himself so it's not bidah. However, some scholars didn't consider the second condition and they said every new religious thing is a bida.  I agree with you the matter is difficult and hidden sometimes, that's why some scholars considered few things bida', others didn't agree.  A clear example for the Bida' is celebrating the birthday of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam thinking it has a specific reward."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I usually don't look for the reason as long as the Messenger Sallallahulaihai wasallam said it then it should be sufficient for us to obey. Once a woman came to Aisha and asked her: &quot;Why women make up fasting but they don't make up prayer?&quot; and she said: &quot;this used to happen during the time of the Messenger Sallallahulaihai wasallam and we're ordered to make up fasting but not prayer&quot;!   Our problem nowadays is that we talk too much and try to rationalize lots of things but we do little.   In regards to the eyebrows again I don't have clear answer but scholars mentioned that it's a type of changing the creation of Allah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You can't deny a sin that you committed because that will be considered a lie. If you repented and never did that sin again then there should not be an issue, your sin no matter how great it may be, it won't be worse than disbelief in Allah Subhanahu Wata'la, yet Allah forgives the one who disbelieved in Him if he repented and believed. So you should not be worried about that sin. All of us - no exceptions- are sinners. That's what the Messenger Sallallahualiahi Wasallam said: &quot;All the sons of Adam are sinners&quot;. If this issue brought up in an Islamic court they can't punish you not because it happened in the past but because either you have to go yourself or there has to be witnesses. Other than that you can't be punished so you should not be worried about that."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   NO there's no proof for that, this is an ugly bida'h."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   If it contains Alcohol which is used to be drunk then you can't use it even if you say i'm not drinking it. Using Alcohol is forbidden no matter what.    The smell that comes from the mouth could be from the stomach not the mouth, if it's from the mouth then it's very easy to change using mints or gum, but if it's from the stomach then you need to follow a diet."
Isam Rajab,"The Prophet Sallallahualaihi wasallam said: &quot;There's nothing better for the two who love each other than marriage&quot;. So Marriage is the natural end if they love each other, but love itself is not enough. The real love comes after marriage not before it."
Isam Rajab,"Asalaam u alaikum  At what age should parents talk to their children about puberty (menstruation/puberty in boys),   and sex?   and who and how should these things be explained?"

Isam Rajab,"Anas Ibn Malik radiallahu anh said: &quot; the messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam never hit or stroke anything, not even a slave or a woman except when he's in the Jihad&quot;. The only man was hit and killed by the Messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam is Ubai ibn Khalaf."
Isam Rajab,If you can't keep all your hair then it's permissible to use pins because you don't want your hair to be shown. Usually women wear loose clothes which allows them to put all their hair no matter how long it is without tying it.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   The 4 before Asr is recommended but it's not &quot;Ratiba&quot; which the Prophet sallallahualiahi wasallam used to do always. Yet he encouraged praying 4 before Asr and Said : &quot;May Allah show mercy to the one who prays 4 before Asr&quot;. This is narrated by Abu Dawood, Tirmithi and Ibn Hibban. Some scholars said it's authentic hadeeth, few others said no."
Isam Rajab,"Wa'laikumussalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh. According to what you've described, I don't see anything wrong being the class representative."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, You can't force someone to pray unless you're a parent or a ruler. You should not wait for the last minute and then tell them let's pray because most likely they won't respond to you. It's better to prepare them earlier by telling them we'll pray soon inshallah, or remind them that prayer is very precious and important.  Your job is to advise and remind. So you keep doing this as long as they're not praying."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   No, don't keep it in savings account. By keeping it in savings account then you already did Riba, you already took interest and deserved the punishment of Allah, regardless of your action after that, even if you built the Ka'ba itself. so don't take any chance, it's not worth it."
Isam Rajab,"Is it allowed to take your bag into the toilet (public toilets) if you have some pages f the quran in it? They are covered inidividually and put in a folder, so they are not open. I do not always have someone with me ot give my bag to so I have to take it with me."
Isam Rajab,"salamolaykom i was just watching this forum and somebody asked this question before me but it was deleted for some reason, if it was deleted by admin for sensetive issue, then you can just delete it again.  Sheikh:  We know the hadeeth &quot;He who imitates of a people, is of them&quot; Shaykh what about Imitating the Kuffar to get news and information from there that will benefit the Ummah of Muhammad s.a.w? Is this allowed?  Another question, Shaykh, are we allowed to join the &quot;armed forces&quot; of kaffir coutries, to get news and information from them? In order to use it against them, and spread the news to the muslims?   BarakAllahu feek shaykh."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, These things need an authentic hadeeth. I don't know any hadeeth says that, so you don't do it without it."

Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   As per &quot;Breave heart&quot; and other similar movies I strongly believe it's permissible to watch it with the exception of looking at women when there's inappropriate scene. This movie is about freedom, justice, defending the land and other values that belong to Islam. Of course there are negative things in this movie and in almost all movies but are they more than the positive things or not? That's when someone who has the knowledge needs to weigh and judge not everyone: Are the positive things within 2 hour movie more or the negative things which include two glances to women more?   If you look at the negative side only then definately you'll come up with the conclusion that it's forbidden just as if someone looked at the knife and he said it's forbidden because it could kill someone and it happened! Or forbidding the coffee because it's harmful and I actually read some fatwas for some scholars 400 years ago who forbade coffee!   I don't think what you mentioned is accurate in regards to first glance and also in regards to kids boys and girls. Of course there are negative habits children may inherit from movies but that's the role of the parents to direct them. Not lowering the gaze could happen in the street or in the mall or in any place.   When I give a ruling based on the Sharia' I'm not looking to an individual case, maybe your case doesn't apply here, that's fine, I'm talking about the issue in general and I'm talking also about a particular environment which is the western environment.    If you stopped watching movies that's very good alhamdulillah. I do so as well, I don't watch movies and I don't have time to do so but from time to time people ask me to watch this movie or that movie because it's good and in most times they're right. Like Fehrinhiet 9/11 or the day after tomorrow and so on."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Of course she can as long as she covers her body and hair. Yet, is it appropriate? Do you realize that you stand before Allah in a pajamas? I don't think any Muslim with strong Iman would do it. We're ashamed to meet people with status in regular clothes."
Isam Rajab,"Wa'alaikumessalam, Unfortunately, I didn't read a complete book for Shaikh mawdoodi, therefore I can't give a fair opinion. However, I could tell you that he received king's Faisal award for Islamic servcies in 1979. He wrote many books about the Seera of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and about Islam in general. He was arrested many times in Pakistan. Maybe he had some wrong opinions &quot;Which we all do&quot;. That's what I can say about him. I recommed you if you have douts to take what's beneficial and leave what's wrong. The prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam recommended the muslim to be wise. Whenever you find something you could learn, you should take it, even if it was from the devil! Abu Huraira Radiallahu Anh learnt something from the devil! The devil told him to recite Ayatul Kursi before he sleeps, so the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told Abu Huraira about the Devil: &quot;He told you the truth!&quot;"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Well, Obviously there are several problems and one problem is trying to solve all these problems at once. Try to focus on things that you believe are more important and try to ignore the minor things for now. Once you decide that there are 2 or 3 major things that she should change then you can focus on them. At the same time, maybe she has also few things that she wants you to do. It's true that many marriages don't survive the first 1 because of lack of understanding and patience and this is very difficult to get through without help from outside. If you know a wise man in your area you may ask him to help you. I agree with you that keeping marriage is better especially if there are not serious things or sins involved. But at the same time the threat of your wife to leave you should not scare you. If you're a good husband yet she's still threatening you then you should not worry because maybe Allah wants to give you a better wife. I know this is hard to say but it's really very difficult to keep someone from leaving you if they want to. Try to be nice to her in words and give her some gifts even if they're simple like flowers or so. Regarding your agreements, maybe if they're written that'll help so it's evident who's breaking his word because I'm afraid she'll keep asking more and more until you have nothing more to give. May Allah Subhaanhu Wata'la be with you and help you in all your matters."
Isam Rajab,"i heard in islam that for some ppl it is haram to get married. if someone has tried to commit suicide and has diliberately hurt themselves in the past is it haram for him to get married cos he may end up being a problem for his wife and children.  if it is haram, and this brother is otherwise a ok person, would you say that concentrating on studies and research for muslim issues or doing arts and crafts are worthwhile pursuits to stop him feeling lonely and to focus his being on something good.  thanx sheikh."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   I don't know. It could be and it could be not. What counts is perseverance not one time thing."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum,  Is naqab wajib?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I don't recommend this method of dawah for sisters because it involves some risks which could be avoided. It's true that it may not happen but it could very well happen as well.  The methods of dawah are not limited so I can't say this way is not productive, it may have many positive results but at the same time it involoves risks and there are better alternatives. I suggest that if the sisters wanted to talk to non muslim ladies they could have a table or booth and whoever passed by them they could talk to her or hand her a pamphlet or a book but even this could be done by brothers. Allah Subhanahu Wata'la made the outreach effort is a taks for men not women, that's why all His Messengers are males. If the sisters educated themselves and prepared the youths that would be much better."
Isam Rajab,"I would say: No! unless it's necessary to study medicine at the first place! then it's a different issue, but you have the choice to change your study. basically scholars have 2 opinions whether niqab is obligatory or not, the majority say: it's not, and that's wallahu a'lam what i believe in, yet, since you believed it's obligatory, then you can't remove it unless it's necessary.  we don't start with optional thing, and then we say: oh, i have to do this because it's necessary now to do so! I'm not discouraging you from studying medicine, we do need female muslim doctors all over the world. yet, maybe you can change the school you go to, maybe you can study in another place! inshallah you'll find the solution."
Isam Rajab,According to the some scholars yes based on the hadeeth when the companions asked the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam: &quot;do perform wudu if we ate camel meat&quot;? and he said: Yes.
Isam Rajab,"I would advise you to direct your question to the people who told you these things since you started your question by saying &quot;here in Pakistan&quot;!    I disagree with anyone who says there's nothing new in the Tafseer of the Quran. I don't recall any of the scholars said that because this simply says that Quran is valid only to a certain time! Actually all scholars agreed that whenever you ponder more on the Quran you'll come up with new things.   If anybody produced a new tafseer without really having new things, then it's their problem!   I already have more than 3 Tafseers for people died less than 50 years ago, and they have new things to add, and no one said that they are deviated from the path of Ahlussuna Waljama'!"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   A book in Arabic means a collection of pages and it could mean one letter or one issue. And that's the meaning of the book in this hadith, the Messenger Sallallahualalihi wasallam wanted to make it easier on the companions by writing to them few things yet Omar Radiallahu Anh felt that the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam needs rest and he doesn't have to do this because if it's something that the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam had to do he should've done it anyway and no one could oppose or reject that. This is the belief of the true followers of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam - The people of Ahlussunah waljama'ah- that nothing the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam was supposed to deliver yet it remained hidden. So Omar Radiallahu Anh was very wise and compassionate when he said what he said. But Ibn Abbas Radiallahu Anh who was a young man at that time was excited and felt very bad about it but it's obvious that what happened is the will of Allah Subhanahu Wata'la and it's the best."
Isam Rajab,"Asalamualaikum wa rahmatuallah, My father is looking for a business, and just recently he found a bakery.  He went to go check it out, and they found out that the bakery is in an area wit alot of jewish people, and if he buys the bakery he will have to keep the sign on the bakery wchi represents that they support israel.  My father thinks that there is nothing wrong wit it because it is just business.  On what basis can i adivise him to stay away from it, Waslaamualaikum wa rahmatuallah"
Isam Rajab,Asalamu alaykum  Who was Baihaqi?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   She used to spend almost 3 hours in the Kitchen every day. So she had her recorder on all that time plus the Quran opened. Every day she decided to memorize a portion until she finished the entire Quran."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Majority of scholars forbade chess except Imam Ashafie. It was reported that Ali forbade it and Ibn Omar.   All scholars including Ashafie agreed that if it caused you to miss or delay a Ibada then it's forbidden.   Cards are like any other type of playing, there's no specific hadeeth about it, so if it doesn't include anything haram or doesn't cause you to do anything haram then it's allowed, otherwise it's haram."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, You should not do more prayers after you pray with the Imam. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam says: &quot;Whoever prayed with his Imam until he leaves then it's written for him a full night&quot;. So you'll get the reward for praying a full night by praying with the Imam until he concludes.  Don't waste your time. Pray with your Imam until he finishes and then if you wake up read Quran or do thikr."
Isam Rajab,"asalaamualykum, im newly pregnant and i wear niqab. i recently noticed that sometimes i cant breath when im outside and i start to hyperventalate and even get dizzy and start to feellike im going to pass out. in these cercumstances am i allowed to remove my niqab untill i can breath properly? this happens at the oddest times, sometimes ill be in the elevator when it happans, other times ill bewalking on the street. jazakAllahkier"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Yes I think you've gone far with your practice, alhamdulillah there are lots of halal food and soaps you can use. for the complete list you can visit  www.muslimconsumergroup.com    The companions happened to eat cheese and Yogurt and they didn't ask about the ingrediants but when they were told that it has &quot;dead&quot; in it then they stopped eating, so if it includes Najasa then you don't eat. but that doesn't mean you can touch or use the soap or even whatever the soap came over! If the najasa is small then it's forgiven and that's when it's solid najasa, but when you're talking about soap or shampoo then you're talking about lots of ingrediants and the najasa is a fraction or percentile, so you don't need to go that far. Don't make it difficult on yourself."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes, Mubarak is a dua of blessings and abundance."
Isam Rajab,"This is not jealousy in Religion, this is IGNORANCE and DISOBEDIENCE to Allah. Once the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam went outside his house to see two men arguing about an aya one of them saying it means this and the other says it means that, so the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam became so angry and his face became so red as if the seeds of pomegranate blown in his face and he told them: &quot;Read the Quran whenever you agree upon it, the moment you disagree, leave&quot;.   The Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam said in an authentic hadeeth: &quot;I guarantee a house in paradise for the one who gives up argument even if he's right&quot;.   Allah instructed us to ask the people of knowledge if we don't know, he didn't allow for us to argue and dispute!"
Isam Rajab,"I know for example that when doing wudhu (purification) for prayer/salah that you can wash your hands,mouth and nose, face and arms once ,twice or three times. But would it be allowed for example when washing the arms that you wash one arm once and the other twice or one arm twice and the other arm three times - as some times I forget how many times I have washed my arms when doing wudhu.  Wasalaam alaikum"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Islam doesn't force you to become a muslim but once you become a Muslim you're not supposed to apostate and you know that the punishment is killing. Once you agree on a term then there's no force involved here. The ayah is clear. I advise you and other respected members to focus on what's going ot benifit you and what's possible to be implemented nowadays. That's much better than focusing on things that you won't be able to implement at least in the current time. There are many important things and priorities that you should take care of."
Isam Rajab,what is inner guidance and do we believe in it?
Isam Rajab,"No, It's more like a decission but not a vow or oath. The oath has to include the name of Allah Subhanahuwata'la or the word &quot;vow, swear&quot; with the intention."
Isam Rajab,"Wa'laikumussalam,   No you don't have to be in an Islamic party other than the party of all muslims and the group of Islam.  What was the party the companions belonged to? The statement that's quoted is incomplete and taken out of context, it's true that Omar Radiallahu anh said there's no Islam without Jama' but then he said and there's no Jama' without Imara &quot;Islamic State&quot; and there's no Islamic State without an Amir &quot;a ruler&quot;."
Isam Rajab,Assalamualaykum What are the benefits of praying the sunnah prayers..i heard that if you  missed some fard prayers that if u prayed sunnah alot that it will make up for the fard prayers that you forgot or missed. Can you pray the sunnah any time for example if the salah is already 30mins late can you still pray sunnah?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Scholars differed on the exact meaning of this ayah but I'll mention what I believe is correct of their opinions breifly. Allah Subhanahu Wata'la sent two angels (Harout &amp; Marout) to the earth to test them after they asked Allah Subhanahu Wata'la about His mercy to humans so they were sent to earth and given desire and lust but they couldn't resist it so they sinned agaisnt Allah Subhanahu Wata'la. Part of the test also was teaching people magic though it's forbidden yet they were able to do it and they used to remind people that learning magic is disbelief.  This ayah declares the innocence of Solayman peace be upon him from magic because the children of Israel used to accuse Solayman peace be upon him of practicing magic and when the Quran was revealed to the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam mentioning Solayman as a prophet of Allah the jews used to say that now the Quran is mixing truth with falsehood by mentioning Solayman. So Allah Subhanahu Wata'la clarified this and declared the innocence of Solayman peace be upon him of magic. Many scholars said that based on this ayah practicing magic is disbelief because Allah Subhanahu Wata'la mentioned that whoever dealt with it won't have any portion in the hereafter, and the only one who won't have any portion in the hereafter is the disbeliever."
Isam Rajab,"The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam cursed those who have pictures and that includes animate objects like humans and animals and he also mentioned the reason which is rivaling the creation of Allah Subhanahu Wata'la. So having these pictures is prohibited due to this hadith, however, there's a disagreement among the scholars on whether this includes photos or it's limited to drawings."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamualaykum  Sheikh, you answered a recent question about how one will not enter paradise unless and untill hes debt is payed off, I Have some debt that will take me a few years to pay off, is it ok to pray to Allah not to bring death upon on you untill you pay off that debt. And my debt includes interest, which I regret taking and I knw the severity of Ribaa, I constantly ask Allah for forgiveness for this, will Allah forgive me, even though everymonth they keep charging the interest on me, is it like im doing the sin over and over again, eventhough i cant get out of the Ribaa.  BarakaAllahu feek for your answers"
Isam Rajab,There's Qiamullail and there's tahajjud. Any prayer you pray after Isha is Qimaullail. Tahajjud happens when you sleep then you wake up and pray. If you know that you can wake up then it's better to pray once you wake up. But if suspect that you may not wake up then it's better to pray then sleep as the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam commanded Abu Hurairah Radiallahu Anh.
Isam Rajab,"asalaam u alaikum wa rahmatulaahi wa barakathou  when cleaning up in the process of urinating I sometimes suspect that urine has splashed onto me or my clothes, however I am not always a 100% sure, but I keeping getting whispers and overwhelmed with doubts that I have become impure so I end up having a bath and changing clothes etc. Do I have to keep bathing/changing etc. as it can be very burden some and tiring?  BarakAllaahu Feek  Wasalaam"
Isam Rajab,"as salaam alaykum  Shaikh, to make a long story short, here are the basic facts.  my wife left my home and refused to return until she got ready to.  i married another sister, she demanded that i divorce her and i havent. its been over a year and i havent spoken to her in months.  can she force me to divorce her?  we have a newborn baby.  i refused to divorce her on her conditions so therefore she has broke ties with me and spreaded false rumors about why she left without my permission.  what is the status of this marriage?  can women dictate/force brothers to divorce them when they have no legitimate reason?  are we still married?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalamu Warahmatullah,   I wonder what kind of Islamic School is this?   If you witness an incident like that and you don't report it or you don't tell the people what you saw then you're committing a sin because as a Muslim you have to enjoin the good and forbid the evil according to your ability and in your case you're able to tell the people who did it since you saw it, and Allah says in the Quran:{And let not the witnesses refuse testimony if they're called}. [2:282] and yes you'll be held acountable for that on the Day of Judgment."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, Scholars who permitted women to lead themselves in prayer said that she has to be in the middle not in front of them."
Isam Rajab,"Assalam-u-alaikum ,  I m just wondering dat how long can a woman be out of her home for studies without a mehram? sometimes during exams or for some  assaignments u have to sit til 8:00 or 9:00 pm for group(only ladies) discussion etc. Is it ok??  some people say that women should not go out after maghrib without a mehram. Is it true?? here in europe we have maghib at 15:30. thats so early and we have to go out. specially for study, our father and brother can not go wid us all the time.. Hope to get reply soon JAZAKALLAH    Assalam-u-alaikum"
Isam Rajab,"What is the detailed explanation for moving the forefinger during the Tashahhud, and is there a hadeeth about that?    Jazak Allah Khaira"
Isam Rajab,"AsalaamuAlaykum Sheikh, Alhamdulillah, May Allah reward you for answering all of our questions. Is there any proof in the Quran or Sunnah that allows a Muslim woman to wipe over her hijab when doing wudu, if before she put her hijab on, she had wudu? (ex. like socks)"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The reason it's not permissible to wear niqab is because the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said she can't wear niqab."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's the Sunnah that you pray two for Isha you can still pray 4 but 2 is better, but if you're praying with Jama'h then you follow the Imam."
Isam Rajab,"If you go there and you believe your dua will be more accepted there then you have committed a shirk.   Allah asked us in the Quran to make dua requesting from him, he didn't tell us to ask at the graves of so-called awlia. Are they better than the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam? He himself didn't ask the people and tell them wherever I die come and ask Allah there for your dua will be answered!  The Messenger Sallallahu alaihi wasallam cursed the people who built Masjids over their prophets and righteous people."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum,  I am the vice president of the MSA in my university. We just had a meeting. And the MSA president, he said that we will do bake sale and during bake sale we will play music so people can come and buy stuff. I tried to tell him that music is not allowed but I did not say anything. Because then I need evidence for this in order to proof my point.  I need advice. What exactly should I tell the president about it so he can believe me?   Jazak Allah Khair  Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I don't know."
Isam Rajab,"salaam,  when i was younger, i had a lot of problems, was sexualy abused, at the same time bullied at school, and also had family problems. most of the time i used to blame myself for it all. and at times i would cut myself, as the pain would get too much. alhamdulillah, since coming into the deen i have learnt our bodies do not belong to us, and it has right over us. iv stopped cutting myself. i feel really bad for what i did, as scars have been left too.  do i need to repent for harming myself?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   You'll be rewarded for any knowledge that's benificial and you may be punished even if you learn the Islamic knowledge but to argue or for evil intentions. So it's not only what you're learning but it's also why you're learing.   It's true that the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam mentioned the hadith about learning your ancestry and lineage but he also mentioned the reason which is to be able to join the kinship."
Isam Rajab,"A Christian asked me about the woman who committed zina and after the baby was born, was stoned to death.  Can you help me explain why this happened?  Can you help me further understand the grounds of forgiveness for such an act?  Jazak Allahu Khair."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes it's permissible. All financial transactions are permissible unless there's an evidence to forbid them.   It becomes forbidden when someone buys something and the deal is over then another person comes and tells the seller that he pays more but that's not the case you mentioned."
Isam Rajab,As salam alaikum Is it permissble for a sister who covers fully (Jilbab and Hijab) to get her belly button pierced?
Isam Rajab,"We are looking for hadith where prophet Mohammed (PBUH) chose community safety over dawah for a particular instant of time.  CAIR-NJ has been asked to speak in a Youth function (12-17 year olds) on 5/6/06.   Some of the kids have been conducting dawah in public places and gotten themseves in trouble with some crazy people threatening their lives, threats agaist their mosques and community.  We do not want the kids to stop the good work, but we also need to let them know that the safety should be considers as a priority, especially if their actions are going to impact an intire mosque or community.  CAIR is dealing with too many incidents of Mosques being shot at, Muslims cars being torched etc.  Your advise will be greatly appreciated.  Jazakallah.  Ahmed Al-Shehab CAIR-NJ President  aalshehab@hotmail.com"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   In the case you mentioned they're still married. Unless the husband pronounces the divorce they're still married."
Isam Rajab,Yes.
Isam Rajab,if it includes dead parts then you can't buy it.   I advise everybody to go to this website as they'll have most of the information inshallah:  www.muslimconsumergroup.com
Isam Rajab,"1- Car lease is Halal, very few scholars still say haram though. Basically all transactions are Halal unless there's an evidance states otherwise. In Islam we have 3 major reasons for illegal transactions. In this lease, those who still say it's haram they say it's 2 transactions in one and there's a hadeeth by the Messenger sallallahualiahi wasallam forbids having 2 transactions in one, this hadeeth is authentic yet that's not what's meant by the hadeeth. In Quran we know that the father of the righteous 2 daughters married one of them to Musa peace be upon him for 8 or 10 years. Also, in this transaction, you're renting a merchandise and then you have the option after that. So I strongly believe it's not haram.   2- 0% is permissible, again, whenever somenoe says it's haram he has to have an evidance, and this evidance should be related to the 3 principle prohibited transactions. However, if there's interest afterwords then there are two opinions again. one opinion says as long as you're sure you wont be late and you'll never pay interest then it's fine, and the other opinion says regardless of your action as long as you agree on a term includes interest then it's haram.  I'm not sure if they really have interest in this kind of transactions, since they already gave you 0%, maybe they have some late fees which are not accumulated by time but rather fixed fees and this is not interest.   3- Buying stock could be halal or haram, based on the activity of the company, if the company sells alcohol or pork &quot;solely haram stuff&quot; then it's haram. If the company deals with halal, then buying its stock is halal. Yet if the company deals with permissible things such as drugs or food but it has some interest then there are two opinions for the contemporary scholars, one opinion says it's totally haram and the other says after you calculate the percentage of the interest and you drop it, it becomes halal."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If you consider the Shia non muslim then yes you don't take it, but if you consider him a muslim then you should take it."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamualiakum, the position of father or mother in Islam can't be filled by any other person whatsoever. so the step father is not a father, however, he has to be treated like an uncle. the stepmother is not a mother yet she's like the aunt. if a man married a woman who already has children, the children don't have to cover themselves before that man, becuase once a man marries a woman, he can't marry her daughter if they're divorced; forever. yet that doesn't exceed the parents, so the children of the step father has to cover themselves before the children of the step mother, and they can marry each other because they're not related."
Isam Rajab,"Scholars differ between Music and Singing. Music is forbidden due to the hadeeth, in the Eid and wedding it's permissible to use one instrument (Duff). Singing also is prohibited according to many scholars and some allowed it. I already answered this question plenty of times."
Isam Rajab,"assalamu alaikum sheikh, My question is about whether a woman has to obey her brother in something that is not generally fard (i.e. if he asks her to do something for him like bringing an object from another room, etc. or not going to some place that is halal and free of fitnah).  I would like to know what authority (of obedience) a woman's brother has on her under these circumstances: - She has never been married and is living with her family (parents and brother) and her father is financially supporting her. -She is married but her father is not alive. -She is a widow but she works and does not need (and does not take) money from her brother or anyone. -She is older than him  -She is younger than him  This question assumes that what the brother asks doesn't contradict the orders of anyone else. Is she obligated to obey him in all halal matters (like she is obligated to obey her husband or parents?)  Does it depend on the age of the brother? I.e. if he is young but has reached puberty (i.e. 13 years old) does he have authority over older sisters (i.e. 15-30 years old)?"
Isam Rajab,"alsalam 3alaikum sheikh isam, jazakAllah khair for answering our questions and teaching us more everyday.  may Allah give you the best in this life and in the hereafter -- ameen.  i was just wondering, does zakat money apply to a relative who is in need of money for example in order to get their kid married (and they owe money for example on things they bought for the kid's marriage that they must pay over a set amount of time, and they might not have the money to do so when the time comes).  does helping them apply as zakat or just as sadaqa?  jazakAllah khair. wsalam 3alaikum."
Isam Rajab,"I don't see anything wrong with this type of selling, actually that's how everybody sells! You purchase something for 150 and you sell it for 200. The difference here as I noticed is that you're not possessing the item and the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam told Hakeem Radiallahu Anh: &quot;Don't sell what you don't have&quot;. So you make sure that the item is availabe with the supplier and then you sell it. There's nothing wrong with it."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   I advise them to increase their thikr and prayer as much as they can. It seems that there's a kind of difficulty while they're doing this and that may be due to several reasons so the solution is to increase the thikr and the prayer to eliminate the tightness of the heart and the evil whispering. It's just like a person who's sick and he's taking the medication, if you take this medication for one day it won't help you but you have to take the full dose. I advise them to read Surat Al Baqara and Ayat Al Kursi in particular in addition to the last three surahs of the Quran."
Isam Rajab,"assalaamu alaikum,  I have a very difficult time determining the end of my menses every month.  Here are some facts of what happens:  -Menses start every 12/13th of the month. -By 5th night, I have no bleeding at night when I sleep. -By 8th day, I have very little if anything, coming out, and what comes out is brown in color, and that to, only a few times during the day. -By 10th day, I have nothing and this is the day I do Ghusl. -I do not get any white discharge which signals the end of one's menses.  The only sign for me is if I do not have anything come out for a whole day. -In my family, the average time for the menses for most of women is 7 days.  Based on the fact that I do not bleed at night (and cannot use this a sign that my menses are over), that I have something for 9 days straight, even if it is brown in color and very small in quantity, and the only way I have to determine that my period is over is by waiting the 10th day to see if I have anything, and if not I make Ghusl on the 10th day and say my cycle has lasted 10 days.  If after the 10th day, I see something, then I count this as residue which can be ignored, I remove this impurity, and make a new wudhoo' for every salah as long as this occurs.  1.  Is this the correct way  of dealing with this problem?  2.  Is it permissible to wait a whole day to see if my menses are over?   3.  If so, do I have to make up the prayers for this day after I make Ghusl?  I apologize if my post was long and confusing.    Barak Allahu feek. wassalaamu alaikum"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I don't remember saying that women have to have lots of knowledge. I remember advising the sister to educate themselves but I don't remember that point exactly because I said lots of things, I'm sorry.    The Prophet Sallallahualaihi wasallam married Aisha Radiallahu Anha when she was 9 years. The intial marriage was when she was 6 but he didn't have her n his house until she's 9.   If you remember I mentioned many points about this issue in particular and the most important point is not to be apologetic or defensive because in western culture they don't have standards for their morlas. The other point is that you don't follow them refuting these suspesions because they'll keep posting lots of things so you should start with the oneness of Allah Subhanahu Wata'la."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, By going only to the magician you're prayer is not going to be accepted for 40 days and it's a major sin. Once you believe them, then you're out of the fold of Islam. I hope this clarifies the matter inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The ayah you quoted takes about protecting our families and ourselves from hellfire. I don't see any connection between this and what you mentioned above! I don't also see a difference between what you said and he said. There's another ayah where Allah says 14:4 {And We never sent a messenger save with the language of his folk}. So you need to speak the people's language in order for them to understand you, but that's not limited to the words that they understand, it also includes the language of the age we're in, the styles that are used, technology and so on. That's what could be understood from the ayah."
Isam Rajab,"Asalaam Alaikum,  If a woman has a chance to marry or re marry a man who has a problem lieing is this forbiden due to this bad behavior? What if he says he is 'working on it' and he knows its a problem but he still has a problem lieing? If he has lied to her, should she take this as a sign she shouldn't marry him? What if there are children involved? Does it make a difference?  Thanks,  Asalaam Alaikum"
Isam Rajab,"Assalamualaikum, My name is Humzah Bangee, and I am 14 years old. I am searching for a program in which I can learn the language of Arabic. Please brother, if you reccommend any programs which are suitable for my age.   Jazakullah"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   I don't know from where you got this translation &quot;Cancer&quot; as it was never mentioned in any hadeeth of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam.   The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said &quot;O slaves of Allah! seek treatment for Allah didn't send down a disease without a cure for it&quot;.   When the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said: &quot;The black seed is a cure for every disease&quot; he said: &quot;Except for death&quot;. &quot;Saam&quot; in Arabic means death. I don't know if that's the word you have, if it's, then it has nothing to do with cancer."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Even if it's for learning, you can't touch the Quran during menses, can a man touch a women and shake hands with her if she's wearing gloves? You have lots of options. You could read it from Books of Tafisr, or you could see it online or you could listen to the tapes or Cds."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You should first try to fast, but if you couldn't then you give one meal for a poor person. Usually the person himslelf should find the poor and give him food, if you couldn't find someone then you can give it to charitable organization and they can give it on your behlaf. I believe ISGH gives food for people so you could give them the money and tell them it's fidyah."
Isam Rajab,Who would choose him? (i just wanted to add that countries with a leader for life are the most stable)
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If you believe that the chicken is not halal then you can't eat it unless it's a necessity. That's the only exception where you're allowed to eat what's forbidden.    Why don't you go to the Halal restaurant and make a deal with them? I'm sure they should give you some discount.   Please contact me because I may have a better solution for you inshallah."
Isam Rajab,salam i was wondering if it is allowed islamically to wear wedding rings.  many people have different opinions on the matter and some scholars say it is biddah.  what would be the islamic ruling on wearing a wedding ring or engagement rings?  jazakallah khair.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If you have a proof on him and you expect him to pay you as soon as he has the money then yes you pay the Zakat. But if you don't have a proof or he denies the money or you suspect he'll be able to pay you then you don't pay the Zakat until you have full possession over the money. Zakat is obligatory on the money in your hand and this money is not in your hand yet so you don't have to pay it unless there's a proof or you can get it."
Isam Rajab,"asalamu alaykum wa rahmatullahu wa baraketuh!  I have a question concerning marriage without wali. I married my hysband as a non-muslim in front of two of his friends as witnesses. It was just me, my husband and the two witnesses. Three months later I said the shahada and became muslim, alhamdulillah. Then we married for the official governmental officials. Is my marriage valid? Is there something I need to do now? May Allah reward you with the best of His rewards. amin. jazakallah khayr."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The right opinion as I believe is it's not Bida since you're using the Masbaha as if you use the mic to speak and the rug to pray."
Isam Rajab,"what is the process of divorce...if a man wishes to divorce his wife because of issues affecting the marriage... he has intercourse with her for example - does he then have to wait for three cycles to find out if she is expecting a child...or can he divorce her....   Having the intention to divorce the wife at some point but not immediatley, does this count as divorce...or once the husband intends divorce fully - does it count..."
Isam Rajab,Allah didn't say if you're busy then you can do whatever you want or pray anyway you like. We have to give priority to our prayers before anything else. If we can't pray properly at least the obligatory prayers then I think we're in a very miserable situation.   All it takes 5 to 10 minutes to do the prayer so we have to fear Allah and repent to him if we felt that we can't give this time to him.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I don't see a reason why her money would not be halal? You already said she works in an Islamic Bank? If she doesn't work in an Islamic Bank then scholars differed on two opinions whether you're allowed to take the money from someone whose money is mixed between halal and haram or not. The correct opinion is that you still can take it unless you know that this very money is haram. As if someone took 10% interest and he gave you this exact 10%. So you can accept her gifts. Once you take this money it becomes your and thus if there's a zakat due on your money you can pay it from any money you have regardless of the source of that money."
Isam Rajab,There's nothing forbids that.  It's still sujud so you could make dua. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam didn't restrict dua during sujud to the sujud of prayer. So it should include any sujud.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   She shouldn't do anything, he's the one who's supposed to fulfill her rights.  So if she wants she can be patient or if she thinks divorce is better then she has to seek a divorce through the Islamic authority in her area."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If you're not sure it's impure then you don't do anything but you can still wash it voluntary if you want. But if you're sure it's impure then you need to wash it with water according to the majority of scholras. If it touches another piece of cloth then the other piece is not automatically impure unless you see the impurity is moved to it which is almost impossible if that impurity is dry."
Isam Rajab,"Sheikh Isam,  I have a personal question that I would like to email. Is this possible?"
Isam Rajab,"No it's not a sin, The Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam mentioned the fact that these are the reasons why people are married. He only wanted them to choose for the best reason which is religion. But that doesn't mean if you don't do so you're sinful."
Isam Rajab,"This is the first time I hear this, I don't think it's true though. What you quoted is a part of an aya, but I'm not sure if it's mentioned specifically in such dua."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Imam Malik rahimahullah mentioned that only wicked people do singing. Some other scholars also forbade it and considered it a sin. Other shcolars said it depends on what's said, if what's said wasn't wrong then it's permissible so it depends on what is said. If it's the day of Eid then it should be ok inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   In principle, spying is prohibited but if there's a great evil that'll be stopped then it could be permissible but there has to be a strong belief not only suspicion and it should be done by a Muslim officer. If the officer is not Muslim then it depends on the situation.    Yes you can inform the authorities about criminals to stop the crime and achieve security."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's true that these things include many prohibitions but that should not effect your work. You're not doing something haram or helping them directly doing something haram. Even if there are impermissible things that are done through your work then you should refrain from these things and the job is still allowed if the good things that you're doing are much more than the evil ones."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   A male can't touch a female unless it's an urgent case or necessary. In this case if you consider it treatment and there's no alternative way then it's permissible to touch her. But for reciting the Quran you don't have to touch the place of pain. Quran is cure and it's possible that Allah Subhanahu Wata'la gives a person the ability through reciting the Quran just like what happened to the group of the companions when one of them healed the chief of the tribe by reciting Surat Al Fatiha."
Isam Rajab,"asalam o alykum  men - they got some grey hair and dont want to dye ,says its artifical and they want to look natural. is there any reward for them to dye those gry hair? is it sunnah?  women - is there any reward for women who naturally dye their grey hair as they age ,?"
Isam Rajab,What should  one do when one visits Madeenah?  Does one have to go as close as possible to the prophet's grave to give his 'salaam' on the prophet (saw) ?
Isam Rajab,"I don't know it.  Actually scholars differed whether it's permissible to shave that hair or not, the Maliki school of thought said it's forbidden, others allowed it. If there's a hadith then there should not be any disagreement. But I don't know of any hadith talks about it. This area underneath the lower lip is called ('Anfaqah)."
Isam Rajab,"salaam shaikh...  if someone does a good deed without having a specific intention set, does he/she still get rewarded for it? like for example if someone removes something harmful from the road, but he didnt have his intention set to do this deed because it may harm another muslim, etc., would that person still get rewarded for it?  shukran"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, Before thuhr you pray 4 Raka'h, you make two and then you do taslim then you make another two and you do taslim."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Allah accepts the Dua in specific times and days and usually if someone performed a type of worship. Also if a person in difficulty then Allah would respond to him as well as it's mentioned in the Quran 27:62. But to say the woman's dua in labor is accepted or the dua after reading all surat al Baqar, this needs and evidence which I don't have. Maybe there's a hadeeth but I don't know it so I can't say yes. To my limited knowledge there is not."
Isam Rajab,"Your concern should be pleasing Allah Subhanahu wata'la, however, if you're a good muslim then others should have nothing against you whether they're good people or bad people.    The messenger sallallahualaihi wasallam was respected by his people while they were the worst people on earth, they still call him the trustworthy."
Isam Rajab,"assalamoalaikom sheikh  A person has two items. Item 1 and Item 2. Both are simmilar products in nature but are of different design/make. Item 1 has some fault in it but works even though. Item 2 is fine. Then the holder of both Items wishes to sell Item 1; does he have to let the buyer know of the fault or mechanism jam in Item 1 or can he let the buyer test the Item himself all he needs, before purchasing; giving him all the (reasonable) time he needs to fully check without specifically letting him know of a fault (although this fault does not disable the item beyhond working, maybe jamming the mechanism from time to time depending on use).  jazakallah kheir"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, In general, if you change your intention during th prayer then it's null. However, if you change only the number of the Raka's then there's an opinion says it's permissible.  I still believe you should stick to the number you intended and you pray forgetfulness sujud. So if you pray one raka'h and you continue you should go back and sit for the tashahud and pray the sujud of forgetfulness."
Isam Rajab,"Is it ok to listen to music such as U2? Even if you do all your prayers including sunnah, staying awake from Fajr, Reading Surah Mulk everyday, etc.?"
Isam Rajab,No you can't.   You need to use only water or it's alternative which is the earth's soil.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Ask him how he contacts Jinn? Usually this doesn't happen without a forbidden method: Magic or so. Jinn don't usually come to us and want to contact us. If he firmly believe it's ok, he needs to rethink whether he's better than the companions who never contacted the jinn or he knows what they didn't know!"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes they can, water doesn't have to come directly to the inside of the eye."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   My job here is to answer questions related to the religion, I'm not here to correct people's statements. We may say things thinking they're correct while they're not. We may believe in things while others disagree with us.   You need to verify if what you're quoting is correct or not. If your quote is taken from the words of the Imams then there's no issue, but if you change it and say this is what they said then it's a distortion."
Isam Rajab,Yes it's forbidden to lie in order to be polite! Actually it's disgusting when you're hungry but you pretend like you're not! While the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam himself went to AbilHaitham Ibn Attihan Radiallahu Anh to feed him! You should be honest and be yourself. That's what you should do.
Isam Rajab,"assalam alakum brother I had a question.  In the lecture coca cola muslim, Abdur Raheem Greene says something like: if a man comes to a father to ask his daughter for a hand, the father can't say no if he doesn't find anything wrong with his iman and if he says no, its like spreading fitnah on the face of this earth...  I dont know if this was a hadith or a verse from the quaran?  I would really appreaciate it if you let me know. thank you.   assalam alaykum"
Isam Rajab,"assalamualaikum, after sawda gave up her night to aisha, did she (sawda) still have time to spend with the prophet (pbuh)? how did he divide his time with his wives other than their allotted nights? Did he see/talk with each of them on most days or only on &quot;their&quot; allotted nights?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Does her work involove improper interaction? anything haram? revealing anything of her body?  If nothing wrong happens I still don't recommend that as she might be required to catch criminals and that involves lots of things which might be out of control."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   The murderer should be sent to death unless the family of the murdered forgives. In regards to rape, besides the adultrypunishment the judge could determine additional punishment."
Isam Rajab,"As salaam alaikum wurahmatulah wa barakatuh   An elderly man had a valid reason for missing magrib prayer , he then went to the masjid for ishaa with the intention  to pray the magrib first , he prayed in the jammah he stayed seated after the third Rakka and the rest of the congregation continued praying ishaa.   Was this correct respected sheik ?    Jazac Allah Khairan"
Isam Rajab,"Wa'alaikumussalam. Yes, According to the majority of shcolars you should have Wudu before touching the Quran."
Isam Rajab,"I pray to Allah for you. This question can have many answers according to your situation. Since I don't know your situation, I can't give an answer to it. Unfortunately, many people think that Jihad is only to carry a weapon and fight the disbelievers, and this is very narrow and limited understanding to this noble type of Ibada."
Isam Rajab,"If it's Iddah of death of husband then it's 4 months and 10 days unless the woman is pregnant then her Iddah is until she delivers the baby.   If it's Iddah of divorce then it's 3 months if the girl or woman doesn't have period whether because she's young or she's old, or it's 3 periods between the menses."
Isam Rajab,Is this true: it is said that people who sleep whilst in wudhu..ALLAH lets their souls visit his throne.
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu Alaykum  My question is regarding husband/wife responsibilities. My husband doesnt help out around the house. He always complains that he is either &quot;too tired&quot; from work or is &quot;busy&quot; doing other things like reading Islamic books or studying Arabic. Although I appreciate his efforts at work and for the deen, I feel that he is neglecting his duties at home. I have children and physically cannot handle all the housework by myself. I am completely drained; I dont even get a chance to shower certain days cause the kids and the house keeps me so busy. When my husband comes home, I expect a release and some help but he just comes from work, goes for salat, and then comes home and sleeps. Im left pretty much all alone to deal with everything by myself. When I ask for his help, he says that Islamically the housework is my responsibility, it is &quot;ordained by Allah&quot; and that you and Jamal Zarabozo are incorrect when you say that the housework is not my Islamic duty.   I didnt realize he had such a backward mentality about these things when I married him. Im completely frustrated and am very unhappy with him about this and many other things. Ive contemplated divorce many times as well but my children and societal pressures keeps me from following through. Should I call a maid without his permission to relieve some stress (the problem with that is that I will have to use his money to pay her and that will also upset him).  What do you recommend is the best course of action within Islamic guidlines?"
Isam Rajab,Yes they can but with a parental consent. Just like the secular law. They took it from Islam.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   In principle, Muslim male doctors should practice on only males and Muslim female doctors should practice on only females. So I don't see this permissible even if it's made a requirement from the medical school. Students should clarify this. People should understand this difference and recruit females to become doctors. It could be a long process but they have to do it instead of saying we can do nothing and that's requried and .......  I don't think we are in an urgent need for males to treat females and based on that I can't say it's permissible. But if it happened (Which I can't still see) then it would be permissible due to necessity."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You can pray it in the Nafl. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam used to say it during the witr prayer which is nafl."
Isam Rajab,"Yes, this extends to others. Nothing wrong with it as long as you don't approve this celebration. Companions of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam did that."
Isam Rajab,"salamualakum. my only question is.. are muslims allowed to get tattoos. or does it say in the qur'an that it is haram? and not to show the whole world, but only if your husband or family sees it. i asked my cousin and he said its not allowed. and i asked my friend and he said it is allowed. please help me in answering this question. shokran."
Isam Rajab,"Waalaikumussalam, The problem here as I see is that you want to give a fatwa for yourself! If you're a student of knowledge and you could research and elect from the evidences, that's fine, yet why you asked a Shaikh at the first place? If you're not a student of knowledge, then you can't do that, even if you thought you can. Unfortunately, many people don't know this fact! Anyway, there are different opinions in this matter, some scholars said: it's sufficient for them to fast, others said: they can pay money or feed people, others said: they have to do both! this difference in opinions is based on some factors, one of them is: are they like the sick person or the old person? Do they pay or feed if they wanted to protect the baby or they fast only? or they don't fast but they pay or feed? If they have to fast, it doesn't have to be before the next Ramadan! If they could do it, then it has to be, if they couldn't, then it doesn't have to be!  Actually, lots of women can't do it before the next Ramadan since they breast feed after the delivery and that might take 2 years! The evidence of Aisha can't be taken as a proof in this issue since she wasn't pregnant nor breast feeding."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Quran is protection against evil jinn so they can't haunt you if you recite the Quran. If it's true that your grandmother's aunt was haunted then it's definately not because reciting the Quran but something else."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikumussalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh, If he divorced her over the phone then the divorce is valid and correct. Scholars talked about this long time ago even before the phone when they used to have letters.   The majority of scholars say it's 3 divorces and now she can't remarry him."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum,  Can you tell me what is the different between Bid'ah and haraam?  I am sorry I am kind of weak in meanings.  Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   As long as you can worship Allah Subhanahu Wata'la in this land you're visiting then it's ok.   Scholars defined the Land of Islam as the Land that applies the Islamic rulings and ruled by Muslims. I could hardly find one single country in the world meets this condition fully. Some countries though impliment this thing partially."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I believe I answered this question twice at least. Anyway, It's true that the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said: &quot;Obedience is according to what's good&quot; or so. This hadith is narrated in both Al Bukhari and Muslim. No one has absolute authority but Allah Subhanahu Wata'la. Allah Subhanahu Wata'la reminded the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam that when they believing women give him a pledge to obey him in that which is good then accept their pledge. Although the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam will never command something which is evil yet Allah Subhanahu Wata'la reminded him.  So there's no absolute obedience to the husband. However, he has a great right upon his wife.  I can't draw a line and say here's Ma'ruf so whatever beyond that is not Ma'ruf because what may be known as Ok to some communities and societies may not be the same in other communities. This issue will not be solved through fatwa only. This is halal or this is haram because the cases are unlimited and the wife can't everytime say this is ma'ruf and this not Ma'ruf so they have to work it out together.  If the husband asks his wife to do something which is not haram then she should obey him unless there's a strong and valid reason. That's what we understand from the texts of the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam."
Isam Rajab,"salaamalaykum shaikh,  my question is about the middle and final tashahhud during congregational prayer, if a person didnt finish one or both of these with the imam, does he have to do prostration of forgetfulness (sajdat sahw) after the prayer?  for example, if you are pray isha' behind the imam, and you didnt have enough time to complete the middle tashahhud and the imam gets up, and then later at the end of the prayer, you didn't finish the final tashahhud and the imam did tasleem, do you have to do sajdat sahw (after the prayoer of course) since you missed one or both of them?  jazaakallaahu khayrun"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   When the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam invited the Kuffar they asked for punishment if he's a true Messenger so he told them that the punishment comes from Allah only not from him and if it's from him he would have brought it to them upon their request. That's a brief of the two ayat and I hope it's clear now inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The righteous men are better but not every human. This is implied in Surat Attahrim 66:4 {truly Allah is his Protector, and Gabriel, and (every) righteous one among those who believe,- and furthermore, the angels - will back (him) up} I don't really see a great benifit derived from this type of questions."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum ya Shaikh,  There are some words which I know in my language but not in English nor e in Arabic. And qiaas is one of them. Can you tell what QIYAAS means?   May Allah reward you for giving everyone one the knowledge of Islam. Spreading the message of Allah... AMEEN  Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikumassalam,   You don't have to do this,   It's said that the land testifies to you so you increase the spot that you prayed on.   At home it's recommended to have specific place where you pray always."
Isam Rajab,I read two pages of the Quran before I go to sleep. Realistically this is what I can keep habitual in my current life and I know the best of deeds are those done regularly even if small. I would like to know how I can make the most of these two pages I read nightly. May Allah reward you.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   There's no prerequisit that it has to be leather. It could be from any type as long as it's thick just like the wool socks. Some scholars say you have to be able to walk with them and others mention other conditions also. But in general any foot covering that covers the ankle you can wipe over it with your hand once and you don't have to cover the upper side of the foot totally. Just wipe over it once and that's it."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's ok to remove your head cover during the Ihram as long as there are no Men.  Also it's permissible to comb your hair and wash your body even if few hairs were to fall but it's not recommended to do so if you knew that your hair will fall and you don't have to do it.    Regarding the face covering for women some scholars said that it's permissible to cover the face if there are men based on the incident of Aisha Radiallahu Anha where she said that she used to cover her face once men passed by. I don't believe it's permissible for women to cover their faces as the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said: &quot;The woman is not to put her niqab on during Ihram&quot;. So here's a hadith from the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam Vs. an action of Aisha Radiallahu Anha and we're commanded to follow the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam. Also, the famous story of Al Fadl Ibn Abbas Radiallahu Anhuma and the woman who asked the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam. The Prophet Sallallahualaihi Wasallam would've told her cover your face instead of turing the face of Al Fadl several times!"
Isam Rajab,"Salamu aliakum, If Laziness is from shaytaan and hastiness is also from shaytaan, how we judge the balance and make deliberation?"
Isam Rajab,"Of course, Allah says in the Quran {let not the enmity and hatred of others make you avoid justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety, and fear Allah} 5:8. The Messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam sent Abdullah Ibn Rawaha to the Jews in Khaibar and when he arrieved told them: &quot;I came from the dearest person on earth to the most hated people to me, yet that wont prevent me from being just."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Wa Rahmatullahi wabarakatuh,   This is not true."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu Alaikum warahmatAllah  My MSA has created t shirts with a hadith on the back, and it also says the prophet's name on the back.  Are these shirts permissable to wear?"
Isam Rajab,"Salaam 'Alaykum   ya Shaykh,    What is the ruling on keeping dolls with eyes and human features for little children in the house.  We know of the hadeeth where Muhammad s.a.w says that the Malaaikah will not enter a house where there are pictures of human structures or animals.  Do these dolls also fall into this catergory?   jazakAllahu Kheir"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   If men only wear these types of clothes then wearing them is Tashabuh or if only the Kuffar do that, if not then it's not Tashabuh. Bear in mind that sometimes the Kuffar begin wearing something just like the regular pants, it was not known to muslims, but later on everybody started wearing them and it's not Tashabuh any more."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I was told that the brothers here on islamicnetwork made a full article about the istikhara so you could read and learn everything you want inshallah.   You should do your istikhara by yourself not by someone else. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam guided us to do the istikhara when we need something, he didn't guide us to ask someone else to do it on our behalf."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, I haven't seen shaikh Al Munajjid, I think they rescheduled and he couldn't make it or so. I also don't like this type of questions (hypothetical) but I'll answer it this time only. In principle, anything forbidden becomes permissible in time of necessity to save the life or any of the 5 nessessary things. Scholars usually give the example of the eating what's forbidden to save your life. Another example is fighting someone and killing him. This is forbidden but it's permissible if it's necessary to protect your money or yourself. There is a rule: What was permitted for necessity becomes forbidden once this necessity is gone."
Isam Rajab,Eventually both monies will be mixed? if that's the case then it's ok. Or you're asking about his resource if it's not 100% halal?   It's always preferred not to deal with someone who's money is not 100% halal but if your company is ok and there's nothing forbidden then it's ok to have him as a partner.
Isam Rajab,"asslamu alaykum  Q1: i just have a question, for example, if you do something wrong publically or privately such as smoking, and want to give it up, but havent yet and then you see someone doing it out in the open or he asks you about it, and you prevent him from doing it or tell him he shouldn't do it, but u secretly still do it, is that considered hypocracy?  Q2: also if you encourage others to do extra acts of worship, then u stop doing them yourself one day, is that considered hypocracy aslso?  JazakAllaahu Khairun"
Isam Rajab,"It's not wrong to say about something you know very well: I know it. or: I'm good at it! Yusuf peace be upon him told the king of Egypt that he's able to handle &quot;the treasury department&quot; this is not arrogance. As long as this doesn't cause you to belittle people then it's fine. I would recommend using another term, maybe &quot;confident&quot; is better than &quot;boastful&quot; since there's really no good sense for it!"
Isam Rajab,"He's shaikh Abdul Ghaffar Addurubi الدُّرُوبي the son of shaikh Abdul fattah May Allah preserve him, the shaikh of my friend and many others in Mecca."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Niqab is not a must according to the strong opinion of the scholars including the great Imams Abu Hanifa, Malik, Ashafie and a narration of Imam Ahmad.   I already answered this question at least 3 times."
Isam Rajab,"Controling pictures in video games is not the same as drawing them or hanging them on the wall so that should not be a reason to forbid video games unless other things are taken into account such as the type of this video game, the purpose and the time."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   There are plenty of Ahadeeth not one, Imam Muslim had an entire chapter on the trials and fighting the romes and the opening of constantinople. &quot;Sahih Muslim consists of 54 sections, section 52 is about trials and signs of the day of judgment, in this section there's chapter 9 and 12 where you'll find these ahadeeth&quot;.   It's not a condition that we have to know otherwise it's not authentic, remember that we don't know is more than what we know as Imam Ashafie says: Whenever I knew something I knew how ignorant I am!"
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum,  I was on my menses, but after 7 days I took a shower and did ghusl. But next day I was still on menses, so I did not shampoo my hair, I just did ghusl (washed my body with water). My sister told me that you have to shampoo your hair. I told her that ghusl is cleaning yourself with water in a specific way.   My question is that do you have to shamppo your hair while u do ghusl??   Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,There's no disobedience in this invitation as I see. Rather there's joining the kinship so he has to accept the invitation and go.
Isam Rajab,"Ok, Jazakallah khair for reminding me as I really forgot it.   Yes Maturidi, Ash'ari, Mutazili and all other groups are not from Ahlussunah Waljama'h. If they're from Ahl Assunah Waljama'h they won't give themselves other names.   If there're individuals here and there then that doesn't mean this place is bad or that place is bad. My job is not to question the Aqeeda of the people when I lead them or when I teach them, this is the act of the khawarij the deviant sect of Islam. I only make sure that I'm establishing the Sunnah and teaching them what believe is correct. They can follow it or reject it it's up to them."
Isam Rajab,"Did you have this from day 1? or you used to have your regular period and then this occured afterwards? Because there's difference.   Basically scholars divide women to 3 types. If you can distinguish between the menses blood and other blood then you could consider the first one as your period, but then even if you're bleeding and you know it's not the same blood then you make Wudu for every prayer.   If you already had menses before and it was regular then you consider that period and you ignore whatever comes after that. so if you're used to have 4 or 7 days then you consider this your period, and after that you wash yourself and start praying and fasting regularly.   If this thing started from day 1 then you look to your female relatives, your mother or sister and see how many days are their period and you consider this your period.   The prophet sallallahualiahi wasallam answered Fatima bint Abi Hubaish with the first option and he answered his wife Umm salama with the second option and the third option is understood from the other ahadeeth such as the hadeeth of Zainab bint Jahsh and the first hadeeth also."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahamtullahi Wabarakatuh,   If you take off your shoes after you wiped over it then your wudu is invalid and you have to repeat your prayer. The foot covering you wipe over should not be taken off according to the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam in the hadeeth of Safwan ibn Assal Radiallahu Anh where he said that the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam permitted wiping over the foot covering as long as we don't take them off. This hadeeth is narrated by Ahmad, Attirmithi and Ibn Majah and it's authentic."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, Gambling happens when you risk something and you don't know whether you'll win or lose. so if you give one candy and another person gives another candy and then you say whoever wins will take both of them then this is gambling.   If a third party gives these prizes then it becomes permissible to give the winner only. Becuase here you didn't risk anything. Here, whether you win or you won't lose.   If you're only playing and you'll return everything to its owner then it's not gambling but you shouldn't call it gambling."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   There are two opinions, and the stronger one is no you should not eat non halal meat because it's not halal."
Isam Rajab,"bismillaah.  i know u answered about babies awrah ad babies stools and urine, so pls make excuse if this is tedious.  what about babies vomit? (after they have eaten and burped etc..)  is it enough to wash hands? is it enough to wipe it with baby wipes of my hands or do i need to use water? and if it gets on ur clothes? baby wipes enough or wash with water?  also about babies. is it a bid3ah to read athkar an nawm over them with the intention ur doing it as athkaar an nawm seeing they obviously havent reached the age of balaagha or the age to be able to do it themselves.  barrakallaahu feek"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   There's no one is holy. We all make mistakes and we all sin against Allah Subhanahu Wata'la as the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said.  In regards to the person you mentioned he may be a magician or he may be a liar only. It depends on the case and it's very difficult to judge by discription only. Nevertheless, this practice is forbidden and we can ask people to mention the name of allah certain number of times through evidence. If there's no evidence then we can't do it. Asking for mother's name is a practice of magicians and liars also so he could be a magician or a soothsayer but definately not a righteous man."
Isam Rajab,"If she's in a Muslim country, the judge can divorce her, if she's not, she has to go to the Islamic Center and they can divorce her inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   who's this man? how did she know him? she has by all means to be with someone when she visits him.   The prophet sallallahualiahi wasallam visited Umm sulaim and his cousin Um Hani, but is this person a righteous man?  I can't give one answer because it depends."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, If the person himself forgave him then there's no qisas and there should be no other punishment cast by the judge unless there's something else on that killer."
Isam Rajab,I don't see any Awra exposed in these pictures.   You only have to cover between the naval and the knee. Some scholars even allowed in some occasions to show part of the thigh as well.
Isam Rajab,"Aslam U Alikum i want your advice on choosing between two options.  I have a choice between memorizing Quran on my own and also using the help of some hafiz brothers and learning Arabic with a shikh                                                                     OR Going for few years for Islamic knowledge where i wont learn arabic and wont be able to do hifz a lot   i cant do both of them together because of time constraint. I am right now around 23 years old , so i m not sure which one to purse. Basically which one is more beloved to Allah , you may say that options depend on the person but i just wanted your personal opinion or advice on each of them and which one is more virtuous.   Jazakallah kher"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I don't know about dog barking but I know about the donkey. Yes it's true that it saw a shaytan and when the rooster crowing then it saw an Angel. This is in Sahih Al Bukhari from Abu Huraira."
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu  What are the sunnah's in doing Nikah? And also, is drinking milk with the hubby sunnah as well?"
Isam Rajab,"Assalamualiakum,  you're totally right, celebrating this day in particular is Bida. the first time it started in the reign of Fatimi rulers in Egypt, the extremest shiete sect around the year 440 A.H. so the entire Umma didn't do this for more than 400 years, yet some people think it's good to do so! we can read the sunnah of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam every day, any day, but when we celebrate this day in particular, then we're doing Bida"
Isam Rajab,"Asslamualaikum,                       If there is a salah going on and some one comes in the 3rd or 4th rakah does our rakah counts as the first rakah and if it does do we have to read Surah Al-F鈚ihah and the next Surah because the Imam reads only Surah Al-F鈚ihah in the 3rd and 4th salah. Can u plzzzz tell me in details and sorry if i used any wrong grammar.                                                                              Jazak Allh-u-Khair"
Isam Rajab,"Assalamoalaikum,                        When we move the finger  during the Tashahud . Do we move it only when were reading the durood or from the durood to the duas after the durood. Can you plzzz tell?                                                                                Jazak Allahu Khair"
Isam Rajab,"Both, it confirms whatever correct in it, and it substitutes whatever was altered by humans or changed by rabbis and priests and completes it."
Isam Rajab,1. If you know that it's fried with the same oil then you don't eat because there's a possibility that this food will mix with remainings of the pork products.   2. In this case you need to see if it was cut directly after ham sandwich or pepperoni pizza because here the possibility is very law that there's something remaining on the knife from ham. Also in this case I don't recommend asking unless you have a strong suspecion then you ask or you can avoid it if you want according to the rule from the hadeeth of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam: &quot;Leave that which you doubt to that which you don't doubt&quot;.
Isam Rajab,"Assalamualiakum, I'm away from any dictionaries, yet I believe it's the soft full cheek."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   If a person wants to study and become a student of knowledge then he could no matter what. If he doesn't want then he won't be even if was surrounded by greatest scholars.   The problem is that many times we consider knowledge as mere reading or sitting with Shaikhs, this is part of it, but the most important part is application. When we apply what we know and we fear Allah then Allah will teach us.   Imam Ahmad couldn't have enough money to perform Hajj so he agreed on serving the people to take him for Hajj and they did.   Imam Ibn Aljawzi during his traveling couldn't eat but a very dry bread.  Money does help learning, but it's the determination of the person himself."
Isam Rajab,"If you pray taraweeh with the Imam and you intend to pray the witr then it's better for you not to pray the witr since you'll pray it with the Imam later on. The Messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam said: &quot;There should not be 2 witr in one night&quot;. Maybe the sisters who join the Imam and add another raka intending to pray the witr sepraretly, therefore, they want to add another raka."
Isam Rajab,"I had another question about my friend who is intersted in Islam. He said he converted to Islam couple of weeks ago but didn't take the shahada. Two weeks later, he changes his mind because he says &quot;I cant be muslim, it's already changing my personality.&quot; But deep down, he can still be guided if he has someone to look up to. He told me that if he converts, his parents are going to kick him out of the house because he still lives with them and they practice Christianity. What can I say to that?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's ok for the brother to work as a security guard, it's better though to work for a 100% halal company &quot;which is very difficult&quot;. His job doesn't have a direct connection with Riba. Otherwise, even the electritions, software developpers ... are not allowed as well which is very difficult."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahamtullahi Wabarakatuh,   It's the same in front of Muslim woman. I don't know any hadith distinguishes muslim from non muslim woman in regards to this issue."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   This doesn't fall under Ibadat, so it's not a religious event though marriage is a ibadah by itself, therefore, you can congratulate them and wish them the best. There's nothing wrong with that."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I pray to Allah Subhanahu Wata'la to make things easy for you and for all Muslims. Amen.   In your case, if your husband pronounced Talaq then you're divorced, if he denied it and there're no witnesses then the judge can't do much and you can't stay with him because before Allah he divorced you unless he wants you back before your Iddah is over. And in this case if you don't want him you don't have to do khul' if you could prove that he abused you, even if you're the one who requested divorce you still deserve the mahr, but if it'll take lots of time and you want to leave him then you should do khul'.   But if your husband pronounced a word like I don't want you or go and leave me then it depends on his intention whether he intended divorce or not."
Isam Rajab,"asalamo alaikum.   i read the Q&amp;A rules properly..   and here it goes my question:   Asalamo alaikum sheikh. I have a problem, basically since a few weeks i get the most weirdest ideas about non mahram brothers astaghfirullah i know its bad, and its making me crazy i cant sleep at nights, i get depressed and i am sscared that Allah will punish me for what i think, subahanALLAH i do lower my gaze but sometimes when i jst see a brother once, its allreaddy fitnah for me. I seriousely dont know what to do anymore.. i feel ashamed for what i think, and sometimes i feel like killing myself astaghfirullah, its very bad..  what shall i do, what do u advice me to do ???   pls i need an answer soon inshALLAh jazaakumullahu khair wa asalamo alaikum warahmatulahi wabarakatuh"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam warahmatullahi wabarakatuh,   No Islam doesn't say you have to, however, scholars mentioned few things that spouse has to look for in the other spouse."
Isam Rajab,i was asked a  question by a non-muslim he asked:  &quot;why do muslims hate jews&quot;?  what answer do i give him?
Isam Rajab,"as-Salaamu `alaykum shaykh,  First of all, jazaakallah khayr for answering my previous questions. May Allah reward you.  I wanted to know whether it is permissible for a woman to ask her future husband, not to marry again, and make this condition part of the dowry.   If it is allowed, will he be sinned if he breaks this condition?"
Isam Rajab,Salaam  Did khalid bin waleed apply perfume to wounds? is this authentic?
Isam Rajab,"Akhi, I think I already answered your question. Ibn Taymia wrote an entire book about sufism, he explained exactly the rulings of different sufies. So if we need to find his stance, we go to his book. This is in regards of Ibn Taymia.  Regarding Sufism itself, we have the book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam to follow. So again, if you have a specific question, go ahead and ask, and I'll answer it inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"Assalaam Alaikum wa Rahmatu Allah wa Barakatu, Dear Sh. Isam,  Did the Prophet Sallallahualaihi wasallam ever conduct an exercism (taking jinn out of a human body)?  Is this practice mentioned in hadith and quran?  When a jinn enters a human body, does that human still have any control, feeling, or conscience?   The reason I ask this is because an unfortunate incident happened in our local community where a sister completely changed overnight and ranaway from home and other things, and many of the community members are claiming she might be possessed with jinn. I did not know much about this.  Jazakum Allahu Khairan!"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   Just as the mother who's merciful with her child may punish him to protect him from greater danger. Calamities that befall us either a forgiveness from Allah or a punishment for what we're doing."
Isam Rajab,"In the Name of All鈎, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful  As-Salaam u Alikum  is Islamic Music is halal or haram? i mean Islamic Nasheed with instrument (gitar, drums, piano.....) and is it ok for site to promote it.  some people say its ok, because its promoting Islam and its better because people will learn islam that way and will not go to kaffir music.  if its allowed, can person listen to just instrument alone, like classic jazz music?  WaSalaam"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,  Couldn't you find better than Cigarettes as an example! It's forbidden to buy cigarettes whether you say Wallahi or you don't.   If you don't mention the name of Allah then you don't have to pay the Kaffarah &quot;the compensation&quot;. Many people think that if they break their promise then they have to fast 3 days which is not true unless you couldn't feed 10 people or clothe them or free a slave, then and only then you could fast three days.   If the action is repeated then you repeat the compensation unless you say several times for the same thing. So if you promise by the name of Allah not to enter that house, then next day you also promise not to enter that same house then you enter it, you do it only once not twice."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahamatullahi Wabarakatuh,   If the Contract of Nikah is initiated (Approval, witnesses, Mahr and Wali) then she's his wife and they can do whatever they want. It's not right to keep the wife from her husband after doing that. Our customs should be in agreement with Islam. So it's permissible for the husband to ignore this custom. However, sometimes people agree on having a period of time where they prepare for the celebration and both parties agree on that. In that case they should both respect this agreement.   The wife has to do whatever both parties agree on (parents and husband) Once she's with her husband then she totally obeys him."
Isam Rajab,"Kaffara means atonement. It's a ritual alternative for the act you're supposed to do. If you made a mistake in Hajj during Ihram then you need a Kaffara, if you had an oath but you didn't fulfill it then you need a kaffara, if you were unable to fast due to old age then you need a kaffara and so on."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The correct understanding is that the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam gave Abu Hurairah the names or the news of the rulers who'll spoil Islam. Scholars talked in details about this issue and how you spread the knolwedge and what you're supposed to say and to whom and so on and so forth.   This is totally different from what the people of innovations say. It's a disbelief to think that the Messenger Sallalahualaihi wasallam hid something from us that we should knew or it was useful for us yet he taught it only few people while Allah says { O Messenger! convey what has been revealed to you from your Lord}. Also, for the sake of argument. Let's say the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam taught Abu Hurairah few things while Abu Hurairah didn't disclose them. Who taught those people save the devil and their hallucinations?"
Isam Rajab,This situation requires counseling not fatwa. I really can't say much provided that your parents are married for 32 years! The best thing to do is counseling.
Isam Rajab,I'm sorry I don't Dr. Israr. My previous answer doesn't pertain to a specific person. It's about everybody.
Isam Rajab,"Yes, the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said that the sun prostrates itself underneath the throne. The throne of Allah Subhanahu Wata'la is very big and the sun prostrates underneath it. Allah mentioned in the Quran in Surat Arrahman that the sun and the moon prostrate themselves, this is also mentioned in Surat AlHaj that all creation prostrates itself to Allah Subhanahu wata'la. Maybe we don't see that physically but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   If Muslims gave excuses that doesn't mean these excuses are legitimate. I don't know any scholar approved what happened on July 7th in London. I was one of the first Imams worldwide to condemn this action and the like of it. If there are people who give excuses then you need to look at these excuses, are they evidences from the book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam or not?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The most beloved deeds to Allah those which are done consistently. Yuo should start with things that you know for sure you'll be able to keep on doing them.   There are many times where dua is accepted, one of them of course is when you're fasting.   You should not show impatience, remember that Allah is watching and hearing whether you're fasting or not."
Isam Rajab,"TO Sheikh Assalmaualakum war rathmatulahai wabaraktuhu Is it permissible to play action or war type  video games which have some maybe questionable content like respawning back to life after death, if the intention is for training for jihaad for the sake of Allah.  Jazak-Allah-Khairan Asslamualaikum"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Yes it's daif, and some considered it very weak if not fabricated. It's mentioned in the book: Signs of prophethood for Imam Al Baihaqi 5/266. Also Ibn Hajar mentioned it in his commentary on Sahih Al Bukhari.  You'll find this narration in Ashaikh Al Albani's book the weak and fabricated series vol. 2 Hadith 598.  Scholars tolorate this type of narrations because it doesn't add any ruling of halal or haram.   I don't know any evidance forbids dancing for women as long as there are no men. Actually, there's an evidence proves that it's permissible during the Eid when the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam let Aisha see the Abyssinians dancing in the Masjid. So I can't say it's forbidden."
Isam Rajab,"Wa'alaikumussalam warahmatullahi wabarakatuh   It's permissible to accept your parent's present whether it's in Christmas or not. It's only forbidden to eat what they slaughter on that day. However, when you accept the gift, you shouldn't be pleased with what they're celebrating.    Most of the Christmas cards have crosses and they shouldn't be kept, I don't really think that people will ask about them afterwards."
Isam Rajab,"Scholars derived from the aya that forbids alcohola an important ruling: Whenever the disadvantages are more then it's forbidden and whenever the advantages are more then it's permissible. So what you're asking about falls under this category. Magic is forbidden, so if the movie talks about useful story and magic is minimal then it's permissible but magic still forbidden anyway. It became a phenomenon to have such type of movies or tv shows. One of the brothers gave me a list includes harry potter, charmed, angel. It began with Aladdin! And the purpose is one: To tell you that there are other powers in the universe that controls it! So again, if there's magic or there's anything which is forbidden then you have to look to the entire thing, if this thing is the purpose of the movie or it's mentioned most of the time then you don't watch it, if not then it's permissible."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I never heard of this hadeeth and most likely it's a forged hadeeth to keep the people away from the recommended acts on Friday. So you don't mention it until you know who narrated it."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, No he doesn't. If someone wanted to sacrifice on someone else's behlaf then it's permissible even if that person was able to afford it."
Isam Rajab,"The best place for women to perform prayer is their house as the Messenger Sallallahu aliahi wasallam said for women: &quot;To pray in your house is better than praying in the Masjid&quot;. however, he didn't prevent them from going to the Masjid. It doesn't matter whether the husband likes that or not, of course she has to get his permission, but that does not make her prayer in the Masjid better."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I believe the accurate translation would be &quot;less intelligent&quot; rather than &quot;un-intelligent&quot;. This is in general, from time to time there are women who are smarter than many men. That doesn't contradict the hadith. But in general this is so true. The hadith is not the only indication. The other hadith is: &quot;Many men achieved perfection but only few women did so&quot;. Also the Aya: {unable to give a clear account in a dispute} that doesn't mean all women are so, but this is in general. You need to observe the differences between the male and the female in order to understand exactly the meanings of these Ayat and prophetic narrations. I answered to a similar question with references to many books confirm what the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam mentioned more than 1400 years ago."
Isam Rajab,"the question is vague!   we do accept our religion with proof, yet we have to believe in things that we don't see! since we have the proof that the quran from Allah and the messenger is truely sent by Allah, then we don't have to question the details about an aya or a hadeeth since we already believed in them. however, there has to be iman in the unseen &quot;ghaib&quot;, things that we may not be able to rationalize, if everything is clear, everything agreed upon by all people, then what's the use of Iman?"
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu Aliakum wa rah matullah I go to a masjid to teach in their weekend school and they serve food (meat) i am unsure of wether it is Zabiha or not. There have been instances of which i saw meat packages which were clearly from normal stores. (like not halal meat stores) I discussed this issue with someone else and they told me that i shoudl still eat it beacuse its from the masjid, and i should not decline it. What should i do? Because i can not simply say  &quot;no i don't want any meat&quot; because they seem to mind when i do. So i just take it and give it to the kids. Please tell me about how i should deal with this. Jazakallhu khairun"
Isam Rajab,"The Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam cursed the women who join their hair with another hair. this may include real or unreal hair. When a woman came asking the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam and he told her not to do so, she didn't ask for a reason! I think it's considered as a way of changing the creation of Allah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   There are two separate issues, the last time of Isha and the beginning of the night.   The night begins with the sunset, it has nothing to do with Isha. So if the sunset is @ 6 PM and the fajr is @ 5 AM then the midnight is @ 11:30 PM.    If the sunset is @ 7 PM and the fajr is @ 7 AM then midnight is @ 1 AM. and so on."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Unless he can stop her from it then yes he should divorce her."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes he's still mahram so you don't have ot wear hijab just like if your brother is not a muslim he's still your mahram and you don't have to wear hijab."
Isam Rajab,my husband and i have conflicting ideas about my health.  i have been thru a traumatic experience and he wants me to go see professional health but i feel as if it might just make things worse because they want to put me on medications.  i would rather not do that because antidepressants and the like have long term adverse affects on one's health.  he wants to look into a temporary solution and i want to do some thing longer lasting.  he says that i need to listen to him or i am not fulfilling my duties.  this matter is causing friction for us. please tell me what my best option is inshallah salam
Isam Rajab,I think there are cases where someone was in a coma yet he recovered after years not only months! So this issue is still under study and investigation and I can't give a clear answer to it. But as long as the doctors didn't agree that this is a death then you can't stop giving them what they need of food or drink.
Isam Rajab,"If you vow to pay charity then you have to pay charity and you can't say paying off your debts is charity. However, you don't have to do something you can't afford. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said : &quot;There's no vow for the son of Adam in that which he doesn't have.&quot; So you don't have to pay charity because you can't afford it."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   No it's not permissible to give a christmas gift! It's as if you're telling them: Congratulations for your falsehood and because of that I'm giving you a gift approving of what you're doing! Looking very bad is not an excuse! You won't look bad once you explain your religion to them and tell them that you don't celebrate the chirstmas.  You could give them instead a persent since the Eid is going to be on 30th or 31 of Dec. instead!"
Isam Rajab,"I didn't see these movies but it'll never be obligatory unless Allah or his Messenger ordered us to do so!   If it helps you strengthen your deen or become aware of the current issues without inappropriate scenes then go ahead and see it, otherwise you should not see it."
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh,  Is it obligatory for men to be circumsized and if a somebody reverts at 20 and does not get circumsized will they be sinning?"
Isam Rajab,Are We forbidden to say Salam to Christians?  Can we answer them by saying 'wa alaykum assalam' if they Salam to us?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Whethear you sacrifice and accept this brother because your father and your family likes him or you should be honest and exercise your right by rejecting him. It's your choice.  Since this person is coming anyway then give it a try, maybe you'll like him, but if you don't then you can ask that man who talked your father and calmed him down to come again and talk to him because you're doing something wrong, it's your right to choose.   So whether you sacrifice your happiness by marrying someone you don't love to please your father and your family or you reject him and ask people to talk to your father to correct him.   I don't really know what to do if I were in your shoes, there's nothing like freedom of choice but pleasing parents also is one of the best deeds to please Allah Subhanahu Wata'la. May Allah help you taking the right decission."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Remember that inshallah you're not sinful because you didn't know it was haram. May Allah reward you for dropping college to please Allah and may Allah compensate you inshallah.   If you could find a way to waive this loan or not pay it &quot;legally&quot; that would be excellent. Otherwise, you need to pay it as soon as possible -with the means you have- to avoid adding more interest. That's the best you can do."
Isam Rajab,If this room is opened and there are people in the other room where they could see you or hear you if you said something then it's not cnosidered Khalwah.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I still believe it's better not to wear the ring even if people had these thoughts. Your job is to educate people and remind them of the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam. What if people thought that a woman wearing hijab is hiding a bomb in hear head? Does that mean every woman has to uncover her hair? Of course not.    So I advise you not to wear it, but if they were uneasy about it and their intention is not to resemble the Kuffar then it should be ok inshallah. You could wear it for the first couple of hours and then take it off."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, Yes it's enough. You don't have to say the whole thing though it's better."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, I'm sorry but what's pap smear?"
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh,  If a mother/aunt/father changes a baby抯 nappy and they had wudu will their wudu be invalid or valid. Some people say it is valid others say it is invalid and I抦 confused, which is the stronger opinion?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   You can have someone to do the Ruqya for you but it's always better that you do it yourself."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The English translation is not Quran, so it's permissible to enter the bathroom with it since it doesn't have the name of Allah on it. But I don't like doing that because it's still a translation of the Quran and if you take it off for respect of the words of Allah then you'll be rewarded. Therefore, I would say it's better not to do it, but if it's done it's still permissible."
Isam Rajab,assalamwaliakum : if a person is affected by sorcery &amp; goes to a person whose outside actions show is a good alim &amp; he says that the person is affected by magic. my question is how that alim knows that the visiting person is affected by sorcery or not. please answer in the light of quran &amp; sunnah with references. is it possible that when the alim recites some quranic verses then he knows that the visiting person is affected by magic please answer in the light of quran &amp; sunnah. and address / telephone of any salaf alim in india hyderabad to contact for the treatment of magic as many muslims are being cheated by imposters in hyderabad. please answer immediately thanks wa rahmatullah hi taala wa barakatu. Please answer as soon as possible.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I can't say yes it's from the manners of a Muslim or not. It depends on his intention, if he's telling him I told you so to let him know that he wished something good for him then there's nothing wrong with it but if he reminded him to show off and put him down then it's not of the good manners. The one who gives advice is doing so to help others whether they listened to him or not."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I answered this question several times.   Saying the Thikr in the morning and the evening. Eating 7 dates first thing in the morning. Praying to Allah Subhanahu Wata'la excessively.   If the sihr is found then getting rid of it will remove the sihr as well."
Isam Rajab,"I don't recall this particular hadeeth. yet it means that your nafs &quot;your self&quot; sometimes asks you to do things that'll harm you eventually, and that's true. the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam mentioned that the devil runs in our veins like the blood!"
Isam Rajab,So she wants to be widowed after few years?   Jihad is a part of the deen so when she asks a husband to fulfil part of the deen then there's nothing wrong with this.    &quot;Fe sabeelillah&quot; doesn't mean exclusively &quot;Jihad&quot;. It includes many things. Also going for Jihad doesn't mean getting killed. if that's what she means he has to be killed then this is forbidden since she's asking something unknown.
Isam Rajab,Asalamu Alaikum  Does a woman HAVE to have a legimate reason for a khula. What if she simply doesn't like him and can't stand to live with him anymore?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If her intention is the same: Giving in Charity and she specified the beneficiary and then she changed him then it's ok, because her intention is the same: giving in charity. be it earthquake, poor people or anything else. But if she vowed to give it to that specific purpose then has to give it."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   There's no authentic source for these stories.   We do believe that Jinn will be held accountable for their deeds, we do believe that Jinn has good and evil ones but as far as this story is concerned I would say Allahu A'lam. There's a difference of opinions regarding Iblees himself whether he's from the Jinn or he's an angel, or he's an angel from a tribe of the angels called Jinn."
Isam Rajab,"Assalaam Alaikum wa Rahmat Allah wa Baraktu,  I am technically married (we have our islamic marriage contract) but we have not yet done our cultural ceremony. My mother said that we are not allowed to have intercourse unless my fiance (husband in reality) seeks permission from my father.   I had heard that since we have had our marriage contract, and everyone knows we have, it is permissible to do anything that is permissible for a husband and wife, regardless of if we live together or not.  Please give me your insight on this topic.  Jazakum Allahu Khairan  wa Assalaam Alaikum"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You should choose the minimum coverage because beyond that you're bascially gambling! You may have a coverage for 2 years where you pay like $2000 without having any accident! and you may have an accident in the first month! So you don't know. Therefore, you don't pay for something you're not sure about it. That's why you should go with the minimum coverage."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If you already researched and found out that it's fard ayn, why you come and ask me?"
Isam Rajab,"walaikum Assalam,   What if your cousin is receiving a vision from the devil instead? What makes him so sure that it's from god? In Islam it's possible that people may have inspirations from god but these things don't have any verdict. All scholars agreed on that. The only people that their visions accepted are the Messengers of Allah."
Isam Rajab,Can one pray with clothing that have blood stains even if they were already washed a couple of times but the stains are still there?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Mariya was essentialy a female slave sent to the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam from the ruler of Egypt, that's why scholars didn't consider her from the wives of the Messenger Sallahualiahi wasallam.   I don't know from where you got this statement: &quot;Islam say when one reach the age of puberty then one can marry!!&quot; Reaching the age of puberty is not a condition for marriage. Even if we assumed this is true then there's still no problem with the marriage of Aisha because at their time in their environment they were adults at that age. Also someone might come and say according to your question: Islam says you can only marry 4, how come the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam married more than that?    So the answer is Allah has given his Messenger special qualities not given to the rest of the Muslims."
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu aleykum wa rahmatullah wabarakatuh  Could you please verify these hadith? I would like to know if they are indeed from At-tirmidhi and Ibn Majah, if the transaltion is correct and what is the verdict on them?    1. The holy Prophet(Sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) said &quot;Without doubt my Ummah will never be gathered in misguidance. Whenever you see disagreement, then hold fast to the Sawad-e-Azam (the great majority)&quot; [Ibn Majah]  2. The holy Prophet(Sallal laahu alaihi wasallam) said &quot; Allah will never allow my Ummah to unite upon misguidance and incorrect beliefs. Allah's mercy, blessings and protection are with the largest group of Muslims. And he who deviates from this largest group of Muslims will be thrown into Hell.&quot; [ Tirmidhi]  3. Imam Tirmidhi narrates on the authority of ibn 'Abbas that the Holy Prophet Muhammad said: &quot;My ummah will never unite on error. The hand of Allah is with the majority, whoever isolates himself will be flung into the fire.    I do not speak arabic which makes it hard for me to find the hadith in the original resources. May Allah reward you immensely! Amin! jazakallah khayr!"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, Ask her nicely if she would allow you to sit with her and talk, only talk. If she agrees then you mention to her what you believe and see what she says. You think she's the source of the problem, maybe she is not. You need to hear from her without assumptions or prejudgment. You should try to advise her only which means you don't want to enforce your opinion, once you do it this way I'm pretty sure she'll be more receptive inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"Akhi the pants of Martial Arts cover the Awra very well, they are thicker than many other pants.   It's true if you wear something light or transparent then it's not sufficient, but that's not the case with the pants of these suits, I've tried them myself.   All the &quot;Thowb&quot; that we wear in our prayers and most of people of Islamic Country wear are lighter than these pants."
Isam Rajab,"As salaam alaykum Shaikh,  I have barbering skills but i won't work in a shop due to the fact most non-muslims and too many muslims want their beards trimmed, shaped, or shaved.  There are so many muslim barbers in the USA.  Are their actions haraam?  Is their wealth haraam?  Or is their a fatawaa I don't know about that makes it ok for them to earn wealth in this manner?  SHUKRAN"
Isam Rajab,Asalamu 3laikum ... sorry if you answered this but i can't seem to find it in the Q &amp; A section  in music there are some certian insturments you are not suppose to use in islam and it's forbidden..  my Question is..is not listening to music with instruments mention is the Quran or the sunnah?   if so ... can you identify which once are halal and which are haram...i need to explain this to my muslim friends inshallah  jazzaka Allahu khair ....may Allah bless you and your family...ammeen
Isam Rajab,"Salamu alaikum,  Shaykh, do you know if this narration is authentic?  In his commentary on the Quran, Ibn Jarir al Tabari relates that some people met Abd Allah (the son of Umar ibn al Khattab) in Egypt and said to him: &quot;We see teachings of the Quran which are adhered to by some and not by others. We want to meet the Amir al Muminin (Umar Ibn al Khattaab) to question him about these matters.&quot; They went with him to Umar, may God be pleased with him. Abd Allah told his father why they had come and so they were invited to meet him. When they were gathered, Umar looked at the nearest man to him and asked:   &quot;Tell me truly, by God and by the right of Islam over you, have you read the entire Quran?&quot;  &quot;Yes,&quot; replied the man.  &quot;Have you acted upon all of it as it affects you yourself?&quot;  &quot;O Lord, no,&quot; replied the man.  &quot;Have you strictly followed the Quran in all that you see? Have you followed it in what you say? Have you followed it wherever your steps take you?&quot;  Umar then put the same questions to everyone in the audience. When he came to the last person he said:   &quot;May the mother of Umar lose her son! Do you [now expect me to] place an imposition on people to adhere to the entire Book of God? Our Lord and Sustainer certainly knew that we have failings,&quot; and he recited the following verse of the Quran: &quot;If you shun the great sins which you have been forbidden to do, We shall efface your failings and cause you to enter [upon your afterlife] in a state of glory&quot;.  Umar then asked whether the people of Egypt knew of their coming to make this complaint. Fortunately for them, they said: &quot;No,&quot; as Umar threatened: &quot;If they had known, I would have made an example out of you.&quot;   &quot;The Ethics of Disagreement in Islam&quot; - Taha Jabir Al-Alwani, pp. 131-132"
Isam Rajab,I dont get this. Is it haraam to have a sexual relationship with your husband? And how can you have an illeagal sexual intercourse with him?
Isam Rajab,"You should not let the financial situation as a wall between you and marriage. Once you find the suitable spouse Allah will help you inshallah, the financial stability is important but it's not everything so I would say go ahead and do not wait."
Isam Rajab,I have been depressed for a few months now and I have been lazy/lacking in salah. I have missed days at a time without feeling horrible about it mainly casue I feel horrible about myself. is there anything I can do to help with the way I feel or with helping me make salah on time. I have made duaa to Allah to help me make salah on time and it seems to be getting worse. Am I even muslim at this point?
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu alaikum,  I have two questions to ask. The first is that Allah says in the Quran that Hajj is a duty mankind owes to Allah. How should we understand it since the majority of today's mankind is non-Muslims?  The second question is about the hadith where the Prophet (saw) said that he (saw) sought Allah's forgiveness more than 100 times a day. Did he (saw) do it in his prayers or dua's or in both?  Jazakh Allah khayr.  Wassalam"
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh,  Is there a difference of opinion about the hadeeth that was narrated by Abu bakrah saying that women's nation will not suceed if they are to become leaders and which one is the stronger opinion?  Jizakallah khair"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes it's ok, nothing forbdis it. I already answered this question."
Isam Rajab,"Yes it's true, it's mentioned clearly in Sahih Muslim that muslims will fight with their swords and they'll have horses."
Isam Rajab,"Checking accounts don't have interest. If someone had interest for some reason, he has to get rid of it right away.  In regards of the banks here in the west. Scholars have two opinions: 1- You don't take it, even if the kuffar took it and used it. Because even if you gave it afterwords in charity, by taking it, just by taking it, you fall in Ruba, regardless of what you'll do after that! and this is a very strong opinion. The second opinion is that you take it and don't let the kuffar take it and use it against muslims, yet you pay it for charity not to feed people, but to pay the electricity bill or maintinance."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You don't have to fast weeks in a row. Some scholars add money to the make up fasting because you delayed making them up. I don't see that you have to pay money. All what you have to do is to make up the fast because you didn't know."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Yes it's permissible to wear it. No evidence to forbid it unless you seek protection from it then there are two opinions for the scholars.   As long as it's covered then it's permissible, you don't even have to cover it but you could fold it inward and that's enough. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam had a ring with Allah's name on it and he used to fold it inward when he used the restroom."
Isam Rajab,"I agree with Abu Ilyaas,   Adeel, you know where to ask these questions, or you know how to reach me inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu'alaykum  If a person who is out in a foreign country whose people follow a School of though different from his. Is it permissable to adopt their positions in places of the salaat that are either 1) Sunnah or 2) Fardh; to prevent fitnah from occuring or if he is a mujaahid, to prevent from being exposed due to the Jaahil nature of the villagers and others. Such positions as; not lifting hands (raf ul yadayn) or moving the finger in Tasshahhud etc.   Jazakallaah Khayran  Was-salaamu'alaykum."
Isam Rajab,"asalam o alikum,  some people say that its okay to eat chicken from outside. Just read Bismillah before you start eating it. while other says its still be haram.  Can you tell me something about this. whether its true or not.  Jazak Allah khair  Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, I should not answer this question because you know the difference between what's recommended and what's mandatory! And the recommended can't be mandatory. If someone else asked then I may answer : ) Yes, it's made-up."
Isam Rajab,"asalmoalaikum  how can I or rather What can I do to or say to the All Mighty Allah so that he will answer my prayers as everything that i have done has not helped me .we should turn to Him for all our needs , which is what i have been doing for so long and still nothing has come to me . I am feeling very discouraged and down and I dont know what to do any more"
Isam Rajab,"as salaam alaykum SHAIKH RAJAB,  I know a young brother who became muslim when he was 16.  his family is not muslim, he hasnt established regular prayers, and he is comitting sins.  has he apostated because he doesnt pray? he knows we pray five times a day but he doesnt know the rulings and the severity of his actions.  what is islams position on youth who become muslim at such an early age but really dont have full understanding of what they are getting into?  they still have so many ties to what they were upon prior to shahadah that its hard for them to hear and obey overnight. for example i met a  young brother in the hospital.  he saw me and said, &quot;as salaam alaykum, my girlfriend just delivered my baby!&quot;  he was genuinely happy and seemingly clueless about zinah.  i was shocked but not suprised, i just made dua for him and all of us.  did i sin by not advising/warning him?  did i sin by not sharing with him what i know of zinah?  Or, was my dua sufficient?  i felt torn. i hated what he said and clearly did for the sake of ALLAH, but i also felt mercy and compassion, knowing it was quite possible he just didnt know better. what is your advice for situations like these?  by the way he said his father was muslim too, and he was on his way to the hospital."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If they teach Christianity then it's haram. If the standards are not the same then we should strive to improve them not displease Allah Subhanahu Wata'la."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Saying Allahu Akbar is not an innovation! The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said it, companions said it when something great or strange happened so it's recommended but it doesn't have to be 3 times.   In principle, there's no difference between men and women in the rulings unless there's an evidence and I don't know any evidence says women can't say takbeer as well."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam. This saying itself is Kufr. However, applying it to the person who said it requires the other conditions. Even if she was joking, that's not an excuse. The religion of Islam is not a subject of joking.  Sometimes people say this thinking that there's a better way of life than Islam, and that's also kufr.  Intentions are a factor in this matter. Ignorance is an excuse from applying Takfir, so she may be excused if she doesn't know that this is kufr. I advise you instead of focusing on whether your sister committed kufr or not to remind her that she can't say this regardless of her intention.   Scholars differed on whether the one who doesn't pray is a kafir or not. The Majority of scholars said he's committing a major sin but he's still a Muslim and I believe this is the stronger opinion. Some scholars considered it kufr. Each has evidences but at any rate, a Muslim can't be a good Muslim or a true Muslim while he/she doesn't pray."
Isam Rajab,Salaam 慳laykum  Does A person have to gargle everytime he puts water in his mouth when doing wudoo or does he just have to put water in his mouth and rinse it only and not taking any water to his throat?
Isam Rajab,"You're right, it's very good for her to visit them. She may take this opportunity and start telling them about Islam."
Isam Rajab,"asalam alykum wa ramatallah wa barakatuh  I would like to ask a question about niqaab  while it is almost related to the previous question, I apologize for this. I am wearing niqaab for the sake of Allah and i do not believe it is fardh. My husband is asking me now to take off my niqaab because he feels it is making things more difficult here in this country. He feels that once we are back in his home country or any other islamic country i can wear niqaab more easily. I know a husband should be obeyed and even for instance when it comes to praying sunnah prayers or extra fasting . In this case i believe the niqaab is not fardh and should i therefore obey my husband and take it off? To clarify: i have personally no problems in wearing it in this country and have not experienced any disturbing incidents other than the usual staring and comments people give. For me it is something i am happy with and proud of and with which i seek the reward with Allah. On the other hand, my friend advised me that taking it off might benefit the marriage relation, since my husband seems to be worried about it. I wish to please Allah so please tell me what you think would be more pleasing to Allah: obeying my husband and take it off or keeping it on,even though it is a sunnah and goes against my husbands request? jazakallah khayran!"
Isam Rajab,"The Sunnah is not to read anything after Al Fatiha in the third and fourth Raka'h even if you're praying alone. However, you could read from time to time since there's a narration that the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam once read in the third and fourth Raka'h."
Isam Rajab,It's not permissible to end your life by your choice. Allah is the one who takes lives.
Isam Rajab,if a girl is raped when she was 8 years old (before she became a women) now she is not a vargin is that her sin or the person who did it (men). if that girl gets married her husbad will think she did this while she knew about it. so what respnsibiliteai doese that girl have apon this situation? plzzz give me what u thing this person should do? the actions that this person have to take?   jazakum Lahukhairan   Assalamu alikum
Isam Rajab,"Assalamualiakum, it seems akhi that there's a problem in communication between the parents and their son/daughter rather than halal or haram issue. most of these issues could be solved by a healthy dialog between the two parties. in Islam, parents have right upon their children. you probably know the hadeeth when the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was asked by a man: &quot;who's more worthy of my companionship?&quot; and the messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam said: your mother &quot;3 times&quot;, then he said in the fourth: &quot;your father&quot;. now that doesn't mean parents can abuse this right and order their children to do whatever they want just because they want so! for instance, if the guy liked a girl, it's his right to marry her, parents can't prevent him unless they support their opinion with a religious evidance, otherwise, he has the final word. at the time of Imam Ahmad, a man came to him and told him: there's a father who asked his son to divorce his wife, should he do so? the Imam said: no! the man said: didn't you know that Omar asked his son to divorce his wife and he did! the Imam said: is this father like Omar? so again, I believe parents should sit with their son and discuss the reasons behind their opinions, unfortunately, many times parents want what's best for them not for their children, so if they like their son to study medicine, they'll have him doing so, regardless of his well, and that's not right. but again, we have a guideline in our religion, children should obey their parents as long as they're not asking them to disobey Allah. hopefully i answered your question(s)."
Isam Rajab,"Whoever memorized the Quran will be told in the day of judgment to read and ascend and recite as they used to recite in Dunai for their rank will be at the last aya they stop at. So simply you'll have extra 6236 ranks more &quot;according to our recitation&quot;, or 6214 ranks more &quot;according to the other recitations&quot;. Also , the one who memorizes the Quran will be crowned on the day of judgment with the crown of honor. His parents will be dressed two great cloaks or garments. However, we should emphasize the fact that applying the Quran is more important than memorizing it. Remember that one of the first people who'll be thrust in hellfire is a man who memorized the Quran! but he didn't do it for the sake of Allah. this reward doesn't pertain to one gender."
Isam Rajab,Asalamu alaykum  Is it not obligatory for the husband to ask his first wife for permission if he wishes to take on a second wife?
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu, If some one wants to accept Islam, can any body make him say shahada? Is there any need for witnesses during the time of shahada and if so, how many? What are the rulings in this matter?  Jazakumullahu Khairan, Zia  zmujib@gmail.com"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You want my opinion or you want the ruling based on the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam? Anyway, Reading aloud in the silent prayer or reading sliently in the aloud prayer doesn't invalidate the prayer. And some scholars said it doesn't even require Sujud Assahu since the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam used to let the companions hear him sometimes in Asr prayer and Thuhr prayer. However, the case is different if the Imam didn't read at all Surat Al Fatiha. If that's the case then yes he needs to redo the salah since Surat Al Fatiha is a pillar of the Salah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Salat Attasabih is a 4 Raka'h prayer with additional thikr in every major movement in the prayer (Standing, bowing, prostrating and tashahud).  You say in every Raka'h 75 times La Ilaha Illa llah Wahdahu Lasharika Lah, Lahulmulk Walahulhamd Wahuwa Ala Kulli Shain Qadir. It's narrated in Sunan Abi Dawood but many scholars considered it Daief. There's no mentioning for it in any Mathhab of the 4 great Imams that's why I don't recommend doing it."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said : &quot;Allah forgave my nation their thoughts as long as they don't say them or do them&quot;.   Yet once you keep thinking you may do it eventually because our actions are a reflection of our thoughts so you may better work on your thoughts themselves."
Isam Rajab,Salamu 3laikum  my question is what is the reward for the person who prays Qiyaamul lay and what is the reward for praying witr?  Jazzakum Allahu khair ....
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum,  My indian friend invited me for the Hollie (a hindu celebration where they throw color at each other in the form of powder or liquid). I don't know if it has any significance with hinduism or it's just a celebration/tradition.  I want to know if I should go or should not go. Should I go even if it has some significance in her religion which is hinduism.  what should my excuse be for not going because she insisted me to come.  Jazakillah khair asalam o alaikum"
Isam Rajab,"Assalaamu 'alaykum,   Is a husband allowed to stipulate things AFTER the marriage that the wife has to agree to for the marriage to continue?   In this case, the husband has a mother and sister who are both unmarried (but able to work and care for themselves at this point) but has told his wife that in the case that either of them no longer has a job, can take care of themselves, need or want to stay with him, then the wife has to agree to that. This is even though the husband and wife are right now living in a studio apartment themselves (no separation for a bedroom at all), i.e., he says even both of them can move into that place with the husband and wife and live. The husband has told the wife that if she will not agree to living with them, then she should leave the marriage. The husband is unwilling to try to get a place for his wife and one for them if the need arises, even if the apartments/houses are next to one another.   I guess the essential question is not whether he should help his mother and sister (although clarification to the extent in which he is obliged to care for them would be appreciated) but in essence is, can the man deny the wife her right of having her own living space, especially when it was not stipulated before marriage?    Jazakallah khair."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   There was a long discussion about this type of things and it's better to avoid it and count with your fingers as the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam used to do.    But if you couldn't then it's still ok you're not drawing near to Allah by this device itself but you're using it for a type of Ibada so it's ok."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If her husband didn't divorce her then she's still his wife. If he divorced her and her Idda is over then they could remarry with a new contract and new dowry if it was not their third divorce. So I don't see any problem for them to be together."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Going to school is not considered driving unless it's more than 48 miles.   One opinoin considers the distance so as long as she goes for more than 48 miles without a Mahram then she's blameworthy. Another opinion considers the intention, so even if she goes for more than 48 miles but that's not traveling for her so it's ok.   PS: We don't look at ourselves or what our relatives are doing to derive the ruling afterwards. We follw the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   There's no authentic evidence for that."
Isam Rajab,Asalam u alaikum  How did the Prophet SAW make dua after salat?  What did he say and what did he do with his hands?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   I can't think of a specific Surah, All the Quran is blessing and useful. You need first to see the reason for your distraction and work on it. Change starts from within, from inside."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu alaikum, one of my aunt is involved in doing black magic for material benefits. Her family members know about it but don't take any action against her as they don't mind it as they are effected by black magic. They invite us to thier home but we avoid going to thier place due to black magic infulence and the main reason is that she (black magic practicing person) does not like us as once we said to the rest of her family members that it is Shairk and the most harmful sin on earth. The cooking is done by her at their home and we don't want to eat food prepared by her.  In Islam such persons shold be hanged to death but it is not practice this way.  Please tell me how deal such a situation and how can we keep our self away from such harmful people.   Thanking you,"
Isam Rajab,Yes as long as there's someone who prayed the janaza then this should be enough inshallah.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If you add to the prayer unknowingly then you only perform Sujud Assahu."
Isam Rajab,"It's permissible to pray another jama'ah, but there are few details the scholars have mentioned, in general, they agree that you can't do it if it became a habit for this group as if they are opposing the current Imam.    Other scholars said the Imam has to allow for them or indicate that he allows the other Jama'ah.   But again, in general and in our time, if you missed the first Jama'h then you can pray a second Jama'ah."
Isam Rajab,"salamu alaikum:  i recently heard someone narrate a hadith that basically said (not exact wording) that if you die while you have wudhu, you would be written with the martyrs....is this true?  jazakallah khair  salam"
Isam Rajab,"alsalam 3alaikum sheikh isam, i was just wondering, if a person took a loan on 0% interest for 3 years for example in order to buy a car, and al7amdulillah the person is able to pay the monthly payments on time without incurring any interest...  if after some period of time, the person has saved up the remaining balance that he owes the company, is it better to pay it back immediately, or can he continue paying it month by month and finish within the 3 years permitted?  especially keeping in mind that this is a big amount and it makes it easier to pay it over the several months than just paying it all at one time.  jazakAllah khair, wsalam 3alaikum."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Allah says in the Quran: {Say O people of book come to common terms between us and you} so these meetings could be allowed based on this ayah.  However, the people who conducts these meetings have to be knowledgable and wise. They can't agree on the falsehood of christians and the jews. They decide to participate for the purpose of informing others of the true religion of Islam. So I can't say it's totally permissible or totally prohibited. In essence it's allowed but sometimes it should be stopped depending on the brothers and sisters who are doing it."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarkatuh,   People are different so you deal differently with each type of them. Most of those people who try to insult or mock the muslims don't know the reality of the Deen. So I would be very nice to them and explain Islam to them regardless of their reaction. It's an honor to have a kafir spitting in my face for the sake of Allah. That's what happened to the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   You can become a psycologist but you can't be with a man in one room alone, you could deal with women or children and there's a lot to be done alhamdulillah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   This is a misues of the Ayah. How it's false while it's complying with Sharia'h!! When the judge rules according to Islam regardless of the used method it's permissible. It's haram when they don't judge according to Islam, not when they don't judge to your favor!  I think my answer was clear, if the spouse took the children and deprived the other spouse from seeing them and that spouse went to the court and they gave him the right of visitation then there's nothing wrong with that because that's what Islam says."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   No it's not obligatory, Allah gave the choice in the Quran  {for those who desire to complete the term of suckling} 2:233"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Maybe she thinks you're hiding something bad or intending to do something wrong because that's what they see mostly on TV! So it's your job to ask her nicely why she prevented you from seeing things in the shop? Come again with a small gift for her and tell her that you're not what she thinks. There are hundres of ways in which you could correct this situation. Lastely, if she still insists, you could call the police because it's illegal to discriminate against people."
Isam Rajab,"Yes they can get married after Khul', but they have to restart everything, there has to be new contract and new dowry as well."
Isam Rajab,"Do the Deobandi HAnafi group people believe that the awliyah were supernatural humans, and may be able to see the ghayb?  I know that they do not believe in praying directly to the awilyah, but do they they think that there is some benefit in praying at their graves, that they are somewhat alive in their graves as Prophet Muhammad SAW?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, There's a limit to the use of the supporting evidences but at any rate; you can't use it merely to punish or implement hudood. Islam gave the witnesses option or the confession. Any other thing used is just a sign."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   If you're certain that they'll use it to download music then yes you can't gift it. Otherwise, it's their responsiblity just as if you gift a knife and the person could use it for useful things as well as killing someone."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The foot covering doesn't have to be from leather. No evidence proofs that it has to be from leather. There's a difference of opinions on whether you could wipe over the regular socks or not. If they're thick where you don't feel the water whether it's hot or cold then it's permissible and it's just like the regular foot covering but if they are thin then I advise you to avoid it. It's not a condition that it has to be cold to wipe over the foot covering. But keep in mind that it's an exception and not a regular thing so you should not do it every day."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   No it's not permissible, I understand that you mean by adoption &quot;taking care&quot; since Islam forbids adoption. This person is still stranger so she can't uncover in front of him. The only way is if he's a foster son or relative."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam u alaykum  I have learned that one of the signs of the coming of the Hereafter is that people will compete in building of mosques.    Does that mean that we should not build beautiful mosques.  If in our community we plan to build a mosque should we make it as simple as possible, or will it be wrong, to put beautiful carpeting, or beautiful garden of landscaping aroung the mosque.  Are there specific colors which should not be used?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I don't get the question so I can't answer it."
Isam Rajab,I heard that betting is not allowed but I was also told that abu bakr made a bet with muhrikeen of mecca when the ayat of surah ar-rum were revealed. what is true?  what are the conditions of betting? was this command abrogated?
Isam Rajab,"As I know, this group is part of the Ismaieli sect, and if that's the case then they're not muslim. However, when we give a general ruling for a group, that doesn't necessarely apply to every single one of them.   If you know these people use meat slaughtered by Muslims then you can eat from it."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Yes it's ture, though there's no direct ayah or hadith says so. But you can find evidences like the aya 8:53 {That's because Allah will never change the grace which He has bestowed on a people until they change what is in their (own) souls} The Quran is a grace from Allah and forgetting it is disgrace and that often doesn't happen without a sin."
Isam Rajab,"Harran is an area in the south of Turkey now &quot;it's not sanliurfa but it's in the south of it&quot; this is an exact map where it is right now with the purple color:  http://www.sanliurfa.gov.tr/    Shaykh al Islam belongs to the tribe of Mudar from the Arab and Harran was not always inhabited by Kurds, this happened upon the conflict between the Ottomans and the Safawis in Iran.   I'd like to remind you that wherever the shaykh came from that doesn't effect his knowledge and we should not be happier whether he's from this country or he's from that country since we're all muslims."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, Which hadith?"
Isam Rajab,"&quot;Necessary&quot; in religion is anything without it you may risk your life! attached to it is &quot;very important&quot; which is anything without it your life will be really difficult. if you believe that niqab is fardh and your parents told you to remove it, then you don't obey them, this is the only way you don't have to obey your parents. I'm aware of some of the difficulties our sisters face in the med. school. yet i still encourage them to go for it since we do need them everywhere. in all matters remember what Allah says in the Quranin surat attaghqbun: {fear Allah as much as you can}. so if you're in a room with a stranger, don't close the door, keep a way of communication with more people so you wont be really in a seclusion"
Isam Rajab,i told my husband that i believe it is necessary for us to begin saving now so that inshallah one day we can buy a house on cash.  of course we cannot take out a loan or fall into riba.  he thinks that there are other things that are more important.  we just got married 2 months ago and we are planning on having children for some time.  we have no other responsibilities financially except our own expenses.  i believe that a house in a good investment and something that would be beneficial for us.  he doenst believe so.  the money we have is just the money he makes and i cannot save it unless he lets me which he doesnt want to.  should i let the matter go? salam
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Not every gelatin is prohibited. It's only prohibited if it's from Pork. If this gelatin is prohibited then it depends on the medicine, if it's for a life or death matter then you take it. If it's very severe situation you also take it, but if not then you don't take it."
Isam Rajab,"As salaamu 'alaykum wa ruhmatuallaah  The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 揂llaah has forgiven my ummah for thoughts that cross their minds, so long as they do not speak of them or act upon them.?(Narrated by Muslim)  Imaam, what exactly does &quot;so long as they do not speak of them&quot; mean? Can you elaborate on this more and I sometimes catch myself speaking to myself whatever bad thoughts I get in my head but I dont say them intentionally.  Does this fall into this category?  baraakullaah feek"
Isam Rajab,"Muslims is supposed to praise Allah always, but that doesn't make it obligatory to do so every single second at every single action.  I don't know about the hadith of not saying al hamdulillah. To my knowledge you should always say Al hamdulillah when you sneeze, but the one who hears you doesn't have to tell you Yarhamukallah after 3 times."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If your intention is not traveling but work then you should pray regularly."
Isam Rajab,"Yes, sujud should be done right away. You don't have to stand up if you were sitting to do this sujud except for some scholars who mandated it.   Wudu also is not a requirement for this sujud except for some scholars."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I suggest to direct this question to someone in germany. I don't know the situation there as I never been to germany."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If these novels/movies/ etc.. include forbidden things more than permissible things then it's forbidden to watch them. But if they include permissible things more than forbidden things then it's permissible to watch them with the exception of what's forbidden in them. For instance there's a movie called (The core) it talks about how the earth will stop rotating one day. This theory is acceptable if we say that the sun will rise from the west so in principle the idea of the movie is not something prohibited so you may watch it but that doesn't mean you agree on everything in it. The same thing with Brave Heart. While on the other hand there are movies like passion of the Christ you can't watch it because its main plot contradicts what do we have in our religion.   Giving human characteristics to the inanimate objects may vary. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said that there's a stone in Mecca used to say Salam to him before his Prophethood. So from this aspect you could allow certain characteristics but you have always to remember that Allah Subhanahu Wata'la created the man in the best form so anything humiliates mankind in such movies is prohibited. I'm not really sure about the 2 movies you mentioned. I haven't seen anyone of them but I think you can apply to the rule on them inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"I reserve the right not to answer this question any more since you didn't answer me : Who of the scholars told wome to &quot;shut up&quot; whenever they asked about this issue?   Yet I'll always have the good intention of the questioner inshallah so I say: Jealousy is a natural thing, I never said no, but it doesn't overcome all other reasons such as the biological differences and the fact that woman outnumber men and all other factors. So if a woman was so selfish to think only of herself then it's her problem."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I didn't get the question, I'm sorry"
Isam Rajab,"assalamualaykum wa rehmatullah,  I have an elderly grandparents who live in a place where halal meat is not available. Sometimes I go with my family visit her. While I am there I never eat the haram meat that is cooked.   I would like to live with them for a while and help them with the household chores. I also want to help her with shopping.  Is it haram for me to buy, carry  and cook the haram meat that she buys?  (Please note that I am a female, and it is not possible fo me to buy halal meat from far off places and bring it to her).   jazakalaakhair"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes, actually most scholars divided it to 2 not three like Attahawi Rahimahullah and Ibn Taimiyah Rahimahullah and others. Some scholars divided it to 2 but differently that this division: Tawhid of Mursil and Tawhid of Mutaba'h of the Prophet. So you have the oneness of the one who sent the Messenger and the oneness in following the one who received the Message. In general, if you look to the tawhid in regards to Allah then you may divide it to three or four, and if you look at tawheed in regards to the servant then you may divide it to two. But there's no contradiction in any of these divisions since it's a customary division."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   It's not shirk to participate in democracy. It depends on the situation. it's always discouraged yet it's not shirk.   If you seek a government help to enforce something Islamic such as a person who gave money to someone else yet he's refusing to give him back his money then there's nothing wrong with it.   In the example you mentioned it's true that you're seeking help from other than Allah Subhanahu Wata'la but it's permissible. If someone works for a company and he's paid they won't tell him this is shirk because you're seeking help from other than Allah!"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I'm sorry but I can't think of a situation where someone is going to miss two prayers and thus I can't answer this question."
Isam Rajab,"You have to obey your parents. Unless giving them this food is a sin by itself, which is not the case."
Isam Rajab,Assalamu Alaikum  My question is:  it is haram to listen to music? if yes than what kind of music? as we see these days even dawa material include some music (in the the form of instrumentsmostly not human voice) so should one not use these kind of dawa stuff? eventhough the benefit might be greater than the harm.  In regards to the music issue One of my friend argues that it is makrooh according to some scholar in saudi so pls give me  some advice so that i may explain to her properly inshallah   jazakallah
Isam Rajab,"السلام عليكم و رحمة الله و بركاته What is your opinion on the use of a herb which is soaked in alcohol in order to get the useful ingredients out of it and then the alcohol is removed from the extract by evaporation? The remaining product which has to be consumed contains nevertheless 0,1% or less alcohol.  Shukran."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Knolwedge will always benefit you even if you didn't implement it at least you'll please Allah Subhanahu Wata'la.   I disagree with you that your rights are not protected because of the lack of sharia enforcement in the US. You're free to practice your religion by law and no one can oblige you to do anything against your religion. And I disagree with you also that Islam in the US is theory with selective practice, actually Islam is implemented more than many muslim countries around the world. Part of your problem is that you seem to attempt to solve all problems at once, and instead of taking one step at a time, you took a negative position by trying to stay away of the religion or blaming &quot;powerless Imams&quot;. Would that solve the problem? Of course not. I'm sure that your feelings are genuine because of your Iman and that's good Alhamdulillah but you need to be part of the solution not part of the problem. One step to do so is to take one problem and try to solve it instead of complaining about a hundred of problems. Another step is to help others in areas where you have knolwedge and skill. Then you may ask others who have been working for Muslims like CAIR and other organizations where can you help? And they'll tell you inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Any movemont in the prayer to correct something is permissible. So if there's a gap in the row you can grab the person to close this gap. If someone ahead or back you could show them to straighten the line. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam moved Abdullah Ibn Abbas Radiallahu Anhuma from his left side to his right side during the prayer."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If you're able to move to a separate place that's better, but you don't have to since they're the ones who sell alcohol not you."
Isam Rajab,"Question: If &quot;Person A&quot; wants to buy a certain product(s) to sell-on for profit and &quot;Person A&quot; is currently short of the full capital amount of $1000 required to purchase the products. So he approaches &quot;Person B&quot; and asks him to &quot;Invest&quot; in this with him to cover the &quot;Initial Capital-Cost&quot;. He requires $500 dollars from the &quot;Person B&quot; to reach the $1000 target.  So, after gaining profit on this $1000 (by &quot;Person A&quot;, will it be permissable to give back the $500 plus profit on top to &quot;Person B&quot; the investor; for example give him $500 profit on top of his $500 investment giving him a total of $1000 back?. Will this be like a partnership venture or will it come under Riba?"
Isam Rajab,is it permissable to get the local mulla to telephone a mother and tell her that her son/daughter needs to get married.  the issue herei s that the son/ daughter wants to get married but the mother won't let them. the only excuse is young age and you have to buy a house first.
Isam Rajab,"There are 2 types of Hijra: 1- Hijra to Madina at the time of the Prophet sallallahualiahi wasallam, and it's ended after the conquest of Mekka. 2- Hijra from the non muslim country to a muslim country and its everlasting until the day of judgment. This type of Hijra is &quot;Wajib&quot;. However, according to the definition of scholars to &quot;Muslim Country&quot; you may not find a single one in the world nowadays! Imam Ibn Taymia defined Muslim country by saying: the country that's ruled by muslims and the Islamic rulings are applied in it! So, According to this defintion, I think only &quot;Maldief&quot; is the Muslim country in the world. Other countries are not. Whether they apply part of Islam, or they apply most of Islam but they're not Muslims! In Saudi Arabia, they apply the Islamic Punishment system, which is very good, but not enough. The same thing in Nigeria, I don't know about Shariqa in UAE but I heard they apply lots of Islamic Rulings, I heard also that Sudan applies Islamic rulings in many aspects but not all. So these are good examples.  I believe that as long as I can worship Allah without any disturbance then this country is OK. Many people live in Muslim countries but they don't worship Allah freely, so this issue is relative."
Isam Rajab,Asalamu alaykum  Are cartoons allowed to give dawah to kids and teach them about Islam like 'Saladin'
Isam Rajab,"Assalamualaykum I wanted to get a clarification that when a duaa is done that one should not wipe their hands over their faces, the only time I know the Prophet did this is when in the night he would recite the three last surahs in the Quraan blow in his arms and wipe them over his body is this true, inshaAllah could you refer me for the hadeeth that proves/disproves the first one.  Walaykumulsalam"
Isam Rajab,"Asalamualaykum, Are we allowed to throw a piece of paper with Allah's name written on it in english?"
Isam Rajab,"Why is it that  despite all the honor, respect and security Islam defines for women, Muslims still all over still do not practice it.  Culture has so much affect on how women are treated, that all that Islam has to dictated is lost or forgotten.  For instance in PAkistan I feel that when a girls gets married her value is determined by the amount of gifts, or money her parents give to her groom and his parents.  After marriage, it would be considered so horrible if a woman asked for her own residence.  And living in joint system she is used by mother in law and siser in laws.  Husband either will not care or not have any guts to say anything.  The  woman's parents are helpless they fear that there might be an even worse reaction by the groom and his family if they said anything.  How can we work to correct all this."
Isam Rajab,What is AOA?   If you're praying Thuhr and Asr at the same time then you don't have to repeat the Wudu again. Renewing wudu is for the time itself but since you pray both prayers in one time then you don't have to renew your wudu or change anything.
Isam Rajab,"bismillaah...  1st  would like to say jazaakhallaahu khayran to shaykh 3isaam. ur presence and easy access is much apreciatted. I pray it stays like this for a long time to come.  i would like to say a big huge jazaakh Allaah to IN and especially to my sometimes eccentric brother sarfaraz 'sas' jamaal. ur a unique dude... i pray we eet sometime inshaa' Allaah.  my question  u have: country A: this is the country i was born in. i was raised upfor approx 8 yrs outside it but spent most of my life there.  country B: i am married to a sister in country B.  country C: an 'islamic' country which i presided in for awhile and have an intention to most likley (70%) live there IF ALLAAH ALLOWS ME.  i left country A to go to country C. my intention to leave country A was forever and never go back to live there except of course to visit family who r still there. country A is a kaafir country which wages war on islaam on several fronts (media, showing islaam to be bad and sending its forces to muslim occupied countries to wage wars against islaam (terror). i ddnt though make an intention to make my hijrah to country C but when  saw it i liked it. (i wanted to go to the gulf instead) this is why im considering it now. I have now just come to country B to pick up my wife and then in a couple of weeks i will be going to country A to visit my moter and father, and ten after approx another two weeks of visa sortin i plan to either return to country C or choose another country to reside in with the intention of residency.  with the above info...  how should i pray now in those countries esp. in regards to country A and country B.  jazaakh Allaahu khayran."
Isam Rajab,Yes you can.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, It's haram to give milk to a child from milk banks since the mother is unkown. However, if the mother is known then it's ok. I know the book of Imam Ibn Al Qayem it's a great book includes many rulings about newborns lots of muslims don't know but unfortunately i don't know the other book.   I'm not sure if it's possible to freeze the milk for two years, but if it happned then yes the baby will be considered her son if other conditions are met, the baby has to be less than 2 years old and it should be 5 times at least."
Isam Rajab,"Asalaam Alaikum wa Rahamtullahi wa Barakatuhu, ' Should me and my husband wait to tell people that we are pregnant? He says he was told its against Islam to tell people before 3 months because the ruh has not been breathed in or something like this. Do I have to wait to tell family and friends? What about to go to the doctor? Do I have to wait then? Please give me daleel in your answer as my husband requires it, JazakAllahu khairan.   Asalaam Alaikum,  Unregistered"
Isam Rajab,"No you didn't do anything wrong, I would advise you if that's the case to stop going to her classes and discourage other people as well to go to her classes."
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu Alaikum  If a man wishes to leave for something that is fard for him, for example, jihad. How should he leave his wife? Should he leave her to her parents? What rights does the wife has..especially if she has kids..and especially if she lives in a non muslim country...How would she support herself...What if her parents wouldn't accept her...and even if they did..they would constantly degrade her as it is their culture that a married daughter should never be supported by her parents (financially)?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   Yes, you can't worship Allah Subhanahu Wata'la without an evidence. You can't add a sixth prayer because the evidence came with 5 prayers only. However, the worldy matters are allowed in general unless there's an evidence forbids them."
Isam Rajab,"Abu Ja'afr rahimahullah is one of the Imams of hadeeth and Aqeeda, his book &quot;Al arsh&quot; is a great book, one of my sheikhs in madina has produced this book with a commentary on it."
Isam Rajab,"assalamualykum,  what is the reward of doing sadqa?  what should be the intention while giving sadqa?  which sort of things can be given as sadqa and to whome?  can sadqa be given to anyone like your maids that work in your house?   does one has to tell the person whome you are giving sadqa ,say,e.g,money or clothes, that this is sadqa that i am giving to you or just give it away?  when giving sadqa ,can we tell any of our family memeber about it or hide from them that i have given so and so a sadqa OR stay completely quiet about it and do not tell anyone?  what nullifies the sadqa?"
Isam Rajab,It's one of the best deeds to please the husband but that has to be within the Islamic rulings and we can't do something good by taking a forbidden means.   The hadeeth in Saheeh Al bukhari where the Messenger Sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that there'll come a time where people would make forbidden things lawful and he mentioned among these things &quot;Musical Instruments&quot; so this hadeeth states that music is unlawful.   The wife can dance to her husband and sing without music&quot;even though some scholars said sining is not allowed&quot;.
Isam Rajab,"As-salamu alaykum ya Shaykh,  firstly, may Allah bless you for your patience with all our questions!   My question is regarding the the fact that:  Rasulullah sallalahu alayhi wasallam urged us to practice Archery, Wrestling, Horse-riding, Swimming (by the way, please tell me what the general arabic word/collective noun for these are??) and modern equivalent forms of these exist (e.g modern marksmanship, horseriding = driving).   I want to follow the sunnah but I am confused.  Because of course the best intention behind these activities is for ghazawat.. but like, nobody fights with a bow and arrow nowadays right?   So my main question I pray you answer: is there still ajr in practicing these? Ya'ni can I still be said to be 'practicing the sunnah' if I practice the old forms, ie archery and horseriding - or am I wasting my time?  (I would be grateful for as detailed an answer as you can give.. jazakallah khairun kathirun)"
Isam Rajab,Asalamu alaykum  Someone said a muslim should avoid being suspicious of others and i wanted reference but don't have it. Is this true and where is this narrated in?
Isam Rajab,"It's not permissible for a woman to have abortion after 40 days &quot;not 4 months!&quot; unless the pregnancy threatens the life of the mother. So if a woman was raped and she became pregnant because of that she can't have abortion. The life of the Fetus is protected and respected in Islam and can't be ended without a strong cause and rape is not so. At the time of the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam, a woman came to him admitting committing adultry, so he told her to wait until she delivers the baby. He didn't tell her that this baby is the outcome of an illegal affair."
Isam Rajab,"when I was young unfortunately I did not keep track of how many days of fasting I had to make up and all the fasts I had to make up since that time. So I made up a number that I *thought* might be it, and I started making those days up. But I never wrote down the days that I actually made up, so, for example, if I had to make up 10 days, I would fast for 1 day, which means I would really only have to fast 9 more days, but I would say that I still had 10 days to make up. And this continued because I never wrote it down.  Recently I realized that this was a huge mistake. I should have seriously written down the amount of days I thought I might have missed and kept track of how many days I have made up. And insha扐llah I plan to do this now.   My question: is what I described above a sin? Not keeping track of the days I needed to make up by writing them down [I often thought I would remember when I thought about it. But I was very wrong. I do not remember how many days they were, so I would rather add more days and fast extra just to make sure that I covered all of them] and then continually fasting but not technically counting my fasts because, again, I did not write them down? Other than repent from this and make a firm intention to change this horrible way, is there anything I should do?"
Isam Rajab,Asalamu alaykum  Say your parents disallow you to wear niqaab for your safety and you decide to wear it regardless of their saying. Is that being disobedient as majority of scholars agree upon the niqaab not being compulsory?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Actually, it is the duty of the children to contact the father not the other way around. In the case you mentioned he still has his respect as a father and he still has all the rights. If he's not good then that's upon himself and that doesn't change anything in regard to how his children should treat him."
Isam Rajab,"In general yes they can, however, some scholars stressed the fact that this should not be a habit for them which means they can't do that regularly, otherwise it'll be considered as two imams in one masjid. Also, some scholars said this should happen only after the permission of the Imam, so if the Imam allows this then it's ok. But again in general it's permissible to do another Jama."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The nature of this life is that we struggle and face many hardships and difficulties so the ture believer will be distinct from the disbeliever.  Allah subhanahu Wata'la loves the one who makes the dua constantly. The believer should ask Allah Subhanahu Wata'la always for everything because he knows that it's only Allah Who provides for him.  The true believer who believes in Qadar doesn't reject what Allah has decreed upon him, even if he doesn't like it, he's pleased because that's what Allah Subhanahu Wata'la wanted to happen. If you wanted to make sure that you're a true patient you have to be happy with Allah's Qadar no matter how bitter or difficult it is. We may not like many things that happen to us but at the same time we always say Alhamdulillah because we don't mind anything that comes from Allah Subhanahu Wata'la."
Isam Rajab,"salam elaykum  Is it permissible for a woman to be a fashion designer?  Fashion Designers specialize in types of garments or accessories such as men's or women's wear, children's garments, swimwear, lingerie, handbags, or shoes.  To be more specific is it permitted to be a designer in the field of lingerie with the intention of women wearing it for there husbands?"
Isam Rajab,"asalalam o alaaikum,  im a sister, wears jilbab when goes out and covere alhumdolila.when i go out to market with my mother &amp; sistr, i always read the dua of leaving the house many many times.   my question is when you read that dua doesnt it mean that Allaah (SWT) will protect you from every harm and dirty peopl outside and brings you back home safely? then why it often happens in market places, while passing by ,some men intentionally touches you either at back with their hand or elbow and pushes and go away. it is so disgusting ,you are helpless at that time? why Allah doesnt protect me from such happening and teach those dirt men a hard lesson infront of you? im only confused ,does it happen coz i am bad and Allaah (SWT) knows so i get this in punishment? it is so much embarassing.why Allaah (SWT) let it happen? it does not happen with pious sisters?"
Isam Rajab,Ihram for women: Does the footwear that she wears has to be same as men i.e. middle bone on foot has to be uncovered or can she wear normal sandals or slippers.
Isam Rajab,"It's better to find another job since it's a door for Fitna. Especially if there's an alternative, and there'll always be alternative if the one feared Allah."
Isam Rajab,That's not true. I would like to ask you and other respected questioners not to generalize what they ask about and to be more accurate. When you say &quot;every single company&quot; did you check every single company?  If the general business of the company is halal and their transactions are halal then it's permissible to invest in it as long as this investment is not related to any pure forbidden thing that the company is dealing with. Then it's recommended that the investor estimates the amount may involve prohibition and deduct that from his possession. If he owns $ 5000 and the company took a loan for $ 1 million with an interest of 3% then he can deduct 3% of his investment at the end of the year or so. Other contemporary scholars said he doesn't have to do anything as it's not his fault and his work is investment in halal transactions but the company itself is sinful for taking loans with interest.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Receiving a gift is not like giving a gift or congratulating others on their religious events so you can take it as it was reported from some companions who accepted the gifts from non muslims in their religious holidays. I answered the same quesiton last year."
Isam Rajab,Assalaam ulaikum. I wanted to know what is the age a child must start praying from and from what age is a child obligated to fast from?
Isam Rajab,I don't know that he said it's allowed. and I don't know what's his evidence.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   During the time of the successors of the companions and their followers there were few people who were famous of havign seizure when they hear the ayat of Allah Subhanahu Wata'la, you can find their stories in many books but I don't know if there's any of them in english. One of them was the son of Al Fudail ibn Iyad Rahimahullah and his son's name was Ali. Ibn Qudamah Rahimahullah mentioned that his son died because of his father's recitation. The story is mentioned in the book &quot;Attawabeen&quot; for Ibn Qudamah. Although this could be true, we have to remember that we follow the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam and his companions and none of them had this thing. Therefore, some scholars rejected what some people did of exaggeration in this matter."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o laikum,        what does seeing red and silver lights means,i read sumwhr thta they mean sumthing in the process of the soul getting purified or journeying towards Allah Almighty.please tel me ."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   In prayer your focus should be on what you're saying during the prayer. Shaytan will try to turn you away from focusing by reminding you wordly things, if he couldn't then maybe he'll remind you with good things but the goal is one not to let you focus on the prayer.  The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said: &quot;You won't get except what you understand during the prayer&quot; so even if you remember good things but they're not from the prayer then you're losing good deeds."
Isam Rajab,"I don't know exactly where did this start but usually muslims use the crescent as an Islamic sign since we follow the lunar calendar in Hajj, Fasting, Paying Zakat and so on."
Isam Rajab,"Yes, you're right."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   Yes it's permissible but it's not recommended. If he's reading fast then you'll busy yourself more by following up with him. You can instead ask before the recitation where he's going to recite from and you can prepare and then you can follow up. That's much better."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum,  Is it true that you are not allowed to cut your nails at night time?  Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,"There was a hadith where Prophet saws) took in visitors and they became muslim then they went off with our Prophet's shepard boy and they slaughtered him and they denounced their religion. There was a severe punishment for them where both their hands and both their feet were cut off, then their eyes were gouged out and they were put in the hot desert on the rocks, where they were left until they died. Would this apply today to someone who converts to another religion and then starts aiding the non muslims in killing muslims. (known deaths, not speculated or planned). And, can we change the punishment to meet our own reasons. I understand of forgiveness in islam, but this was treason to a very high degree."
Isam Rajab,"AssalaamAlaykum  I have a question pertaining to ghusl.  When you run your fingers through your hair to make sure the water reaches the roots, how many times do you have to do this? Three times or only once?  JaazkumAllaahu Khairun."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum,  Can a woman wear make-up? Some says that wearing make-up is haram while other says that you can only wear make-up for your husband.   I shall be thankful to you if you explain this and give me some evidence.  Jazak Allah khair  Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,I just got removable braces. Do i need to remove them everytime i do wadu ?  jzk
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh, This dua is to be said after the athan only. But if it was said after the Iqamah also then there could be a basis from the meaning of the hadith since the Iqamah is also a call for the prayer."
Isam Rajab,"In principle, both genders are to lower their gaze as Allah said in the Quran in Surat Annur. However, if there's a need then a man can look at a woman if he's talking to her as long as there's no fitnah involved.  On the other side, women can look at men even if there's no need but there's a reason as long as there's no fitnah, just like Aishah Radiallahu Anha when she was looking at the abyssinians playing in the masjid and the woman who was looking at Al Fadl ibn Al Abbas Radiallahu Anhuma."
Isam Rajab,"Salam alaikum sheikh, you stated:     Quote:     Originally Posted by  Isam Rajab IN-House Shaikh   You can say ANY Dua in Sujud in ANY language as long as you said Subhana rabial a'la.        I just wanted to know if you can provide with [the names of] other scholars who follow the same opinion and the evidence behind it so I can show it to my friends Inshallah.   Jazakullah   salam"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes you should, If you swear to Allah to do something in the future and you don't do it then you have to fulfill the Kaffara. Allah commanded the believers not to mention His name excessively in the oath.   If you did that for the sake of Allah and out of a sincere intention then you still have to do the kaffara, so how when you do it because of Shaytan?"
Isam Rajab,"Is it wrong for a husband to offer assistance to his wife and mother-in-law with their make-up, hair, picking clothes and shoes and so on for special occasions?"
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu Alaikum  I have read different opinions on this. I have read the hadeeth saheeh Muslim, that isha ends at midnight. I thought this was clear but i've heard many people say it finishes at fajr. Is there any ikhtilaaf regarding when the time of isha prayer finishes? What is most correct opinion, or the opinion of the majority?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Siraaj, I'm sorry but I can't do that now. This may take few good hours while I'm really busy and it's not one of my priorities now.   Maybe in the summer inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   It depends on the intention of the person, even if he intended to make fun of the sister that doesn't make it kufr because it maybe the way she's dressed, but if he made fun of the ruling itself then it becomes Kufr.    If someone came to me and he made fun of me because of my beard that doesn't mean it's kufr but if he makes fun of growing the beard itself then it becomes kufr."
Isam Rajab,"as salamo alaykum shaykh Isam,  This question was posted on another forum by a brother who lives in South Korea. Barak Allahu feek.   &quot;A Question arosed and I do not know how to reply. Please help me.  Me and one of my Muslim friend met on the street after Thuhur time, and spent some time together.  Time for Asr prayer came, and I went up to the roof of the near building. (I'm Korean, and this is Korea. There's no Masjid except very few) After I finished preparing everything for Salah, I said &quot;Let's give prayer&quot;. He said &quot;I've already given Asr prayer&quot;. I replyed &quot;How come?&quot; He said &quot;I combined Thuhur and Asr before I leave my house&quot; Definitely, he was not travelling.  On that evening, he showed me the below Hadith and other Hadiths that say it's OK to combine prayer even when we are NOT travelling. Ibn Abbas reported: The messenger of Allah(may peace be upon him) observed the noon and afternoon prayers together in Medina without being in a state of fear or in a state of journey. Abu Zubair said: I asked Sa'id[one of the narrators] why he did that. He said: I asked Ibn Abbas as you have asked me, and he replied that he[the Holy prophet] wanted that no one among his Ummah should be put to [unnecessary] hardship.  Sahih Muslim, English version, Chapter CCL, Tradition #1516  What is correct opinion on this matter? Can we combine Prayer even though we are not in the state of jouney? Exatcly in what cases except travelling can we combine Prayer? Anyone who can answer me in the fiqh point of view?  Jazakumullah khairan.&quot;"
Isam Rajab,"asalam o alikum,   In one of the answer you mentioned that taking loans with interest is haraam. But what about those loans that are interest free?   And also when you purchase a car you have to pay in installment, which means that you pay the interest on it. In this case what one should do as you know that a car is necessary in the united states because where we live public transport is limited.  Jazak Allah Khair   Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   What exactly the percussion insturments?  Why don't you ask them! : )"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If there's no way at all except by paying interest then yes it's obligatory to seek the lower interest than the higher interest. However, I don't mean by that you should go to another company because some comapnies don't pay off your credit unless they have your house as a mortage in case you were unable to pay them back. So you have to be careful. But in principle, of course you have to seek all means to lower your interest as long as you're unable to eliminate it."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It depends on why she wants to change her surname?  If it's a bad name or a name that has a meaning that is not approved by our religion then she should change it because the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam changed the names that have wrong meanings. If she was an non muslim and she embraces Islam then she can change it but she doesn't have to.   If not, then she should not change her surname especially if it's a mere resembling to the west.   The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam forbade us from attributing ourselves to other than our parents and this may happen if we change the surname and based on that it should be haram. Otherwise, it's not haram but it's disliked because it was never known in Islam that a wife changes her name to her hsuband's."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   If you already prayed Witr then you have the option whether to pray one Raka't and then you pray regularly 2 rak'at 2 rak'at then you pray 1 raka't. Or you just pray 2 raka't 2 raka't and you consider the witr you prayed before sleeping valid. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said: &quot;There should be no two witrs in one night&quot;."
Isam Rajab,"asalamu aleykum   I wanna get married to a sister, two of my family members and i are going to meet the father of the sister. Now after the father gives me the permission to get married to her in the future, is the Nikah done or is there more to be done?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   I agree with you, there's actually no evidence says that you should have one piece. Islam told women to cover their heads and bodies, but didn't tell them it should be one piece. It's not the first extreme fatwa that they post. There are few other similar fatwas as well, but I really don't like to criticize because they're doing a great job mashallah.   I'm planning to meet with Shaikh Al Munajjid inshallah this month because I want to bring this issue to his attention. Fatwas should consider the questioner himself and the current situation in the frame of Sharia."
Isam Rajab,"to some extent, that might be ture. if some people grouped always to disobey Allah subhanahu wata'la and they did that constantly, ecouraged each other to do it, then, yes you're right, they might be punished more than if someone did it alone. but again, this applies if they are encouraging each other to sin. Allah subhanahuwata'la cursed the people who disbelieved from the children of Israel because they didn't advise each other to stop sinning. and the messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam cautioned the peole that if they don't enjoin the good and forbid the evil then Allah will punish them as a group."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikumuassalam, I'm sorry but I really think she needs to see a psychiatrist."
Isam Rajab,Asalamu alaykum  What is the meaning to the following:  &quot;Fazfar Bi-Thaat id-Deen - Taribat Yadaak.&quot;
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   When you talk to a non Muslim, you need to know how you talk to him and what issues to bring forth. If your friend started the descussion about this topic then he's wrong, if the non Muslim did that and your friend started replying then he's also wrong. What's the use of proving the equity in Islam if you ignore the oness of Allah or you don't believe in Quran or Sunnah?    Anyway, regarding slavery. Islam didn't ban it, it's still allowed. but it's true that Islam encouraged ending slavery and took all means to do that.   Remember that Islam is like all other religions who allow slavery. This is something in Christianity and Judaism as well. As long as there's Jihad there'll be slavery. Slavery in Islam is not based on personal gains it's based on war and fighting.   Most of the Messengers of Allah Peace be upon them had slaves. So again you need to know what to talk about or it's better then not to talk at all or let others who have knowledge deal with this issue."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I don't know her. Ibn Hajr Rahimahullah mentioned that the wife of Al Abbas Radiallahu Anh is Lubabah, so I don't know if that's her or not.  The same thing with Labiba. I don't know too."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Statistically, over 80% of people have stage fright so it's something normal and sometimes it's a positive thing. If you're used to speak and do presentations all the time then this is something good in a sense that you could communicate and present your ideas or projects but what do you do exactly? If these presentations and talks are about the religion or things that'll help you come close to Allah Subhanahu Wata'la and please Him then definately this is a positive thing. Speaking before males varies based on the reason and the need of that speech. Your focus should not be whether you should speak or not but rather you should look for the caree itself that you're pursueing. I don't see anything wrong with your quesiton so you don't have to apologize."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Did she give you this status (Executor) as an heir so you get a share of it or she gave you the authority to distribute it the way you want? If it's inheritence then you can't take it but if she gave you the option to do whatever you want with the money then you can take it."
Isam Rajab,If she can read the Quran then she can make Sujud.
Isam Rajab,what are the rules on the beard  How lond does it have to be on the cheeks and chin?  Can you shave the neck?
Isam Rajab,"i used to have lots of divine raptures,wonderful feelings in my heart from Allah Almighty but they don't come nohw .its been quite a long time .plus i see red ,golden and silver lights from Allah Almighty.i read it sumwhr like its a gud thing or i dunt remeber to see them is a sign from Allah subhanahuwatala.please tell me what should i do and what is your opinion aboput these ights.plus plz tell me what can i do to get closer to Allah Tala?i miss my raptures alot!"
Isam Rajab,"If a lot of calamities befall on me, one after the other (before I could barely recover from the last), is it my fault? What am I doing wrong?"
Isam Rajab,"Asalam alaykum  A sister has asked me to seek advice on her behalf, she is really embarrassed to ask this question and wants to remain anonymous.  JazakaAlahu Khairan Wasalam    慳salamalaikumu waa抮amtu抋llah  I have a very serious problem which I can抰 seem to control. I抦 addicted to sex/masturbation and I just don抰 know how to control myself. As a kafir you抮e told that masturbating is something healthy and we抮e encouraged towards it. I have tried to find myself a spouse but there are a lot of complications in my life. I haven抰 being a muslim for long time and I have left every displeasing thing when I entered Islam except this. I want sincere advice regarding this issue. I have tried to fast but when I抦 fasting I feel the same. Mentally I am not able to stop and end up crying my eyes out and sometimes I don抰 even feel guilty about it as it抯 become a habit.   I feel so dirty going infront of Allah knowing I am doing this. I抳e being told that masturbation is haram in islam. Shiek HELP ME please, I really need your advice.  May Allah preserve you amin  asalamalaikumu waa抮amtu抋llah"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Because that's what the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam asked us to say after we leave the restroom. Some scholars said that once you relieve yourself and you discharge all harmful things from your body there's some kind of difficulty so you remember the punishment which is more difficult and you ask Allah for forgiveness."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Allah subhanahu Wata'la answers the duas anywhere and anytime, yet there are specific times where dua is most likely accepted due to an evidence. So this intention is not wrong that you're in the house of Allah so your dua is most likely accepted yet that's not a guarantee because the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam mentioned the man who comes for hajj in a long journey yet his money is not halal so his dua is not accepted."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   It's not permissible to sell alcohol whatsoever. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam cursed the one who sells it, buys it, delivers it, makes it, etc... All of them are equal in sin. Allah says in the Quran 65:2 {And whosoever fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty)}."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You need to remember that we all have tests in this life and this is part of the test for you so you should persevere. At least your relatives acknowledge the fact that going to Islamic school will help you becoming perfect, that's why they blame you if you did something wrong so you should be happy with that.   You should not be engaged in any discussion with your uncle or any other relative if you already know that the matter will be worse. You can't force them to change their falsehood so you only advise them and that's all. If you believe there's a well respected person whom they'll listen to then maybe you need to let him talk to your relatives instead of you. Be confident of what you're doing and that's what really matters. One day inshallah you'll prosper more and more and they'll know that you were right."
Isam Rajab,"Assalaamu Alaykum war-Rahmatullahi wa-Baarakatu,  I was just wondering if it possible to repent from everything every night, like without repenting for specific sins.  For instance, you committed some sins during the day, could you at night just repent for any wrong you did during the whole day without being specific about which sins you are repenting for?  BaarakAllahu Feekum, Wa-Saalaamu Alaykum."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I don't know."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   No it's not permissible. During the time of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam when the incident of Li'an happened and the man accused his wife, the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam applied the ruling of Allah but he also gave the people the description of the child if she lied and if she said the truth, and the child came according to the description that she lied yet he didn't punish her and he said &quot;had it not been for the book of Allah, I would have done a different thing&quot;. This is very similar to the case of DNA. Until now, there are few mistakes with DNA and there's a possibility of error even if it's very rare. Nevertheless we have the book of Allah and Islam and that's enough."
Isam Rajab,"As Salamualaykum,  At our work place, we have brothers who would only hold jamaah after the Hanafi `Asr time sighting the fact that its &quot;safer&quot; to pray at that time since it is agreed by all the madhahib.   My question is: is it ok for us to intentionally delay to pray with these brothers or should we go ahead and pray ourselves? or should we try to convince them otherwise?  barak Allahu feek, wassalam"
Isam Rajab,"in my work place when we start work people say &quot;hi&quot; and smile, in the case it's a women, can we smile back?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, The biological father is more worthy of his son than the step father even if the step father is more religious and might produce better education to your son. You can't deprive the father from this right, however, you can request in your will something to protect this and secure it."
Isam Rajab,"Assallaamu 3laikum Shaykh Isam,  I am a brother who is wanting to know if it is permissible to give to dawah to females, muslims or non-muslims. Of course with good intentions.  Also, is there a hadeeth that says something of a close meaning to &quot; one of the signs of the end of time will be young men preaching to females&quot; forgive my inacurracy of the wordings of the hadeeth.  Jazakumallahu khairan"
Isam Rajab,If you fast Friday then you should fast a day before it or a day after it. That's what the Messenger Sallallahualihi wasallam said in an authentic hadeeth narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The Ayah says his throne was above water.  When Allah Subhanahu Wata'la rose above his throne He was not underneath it but He created it and He rose above it.  I don't know exactly who's of the salf you're talking about so I don't remember the words. I advise you to stop discussing these details which will not help you much in practicing your religion."
Isam Rajab,"as salaamu alaikum shaikh,  my periods are usually very regular and what I've been noticing for the past few times I've had my period is that it usually begins with a little bit of spotting, and then I get nothing, and then the bleeding starts again.  This time, I was expecting my period yesterday, but instead I got some brownish discharge and then nothing for almost 24 hours.  I did not pray thinking my period has started.    Should I wait until my period starts? or do I just pray during this time?  My period should start around this time, so how long should I wait until I get something?  Or should I just excuse it and pray (and also make up the prayers I missed yesterday)?  baarakallahu fik."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamualiakum,  Awtas is a battle connected to the conquest of Mekka, so actually there's nothing specific about it. and therefore, the Muta was banned after the conquest of Mekka wallahu a'lam."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You can't pray before the time of the prayer which starts with the Athan. There's a consensus on this matter."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   I don't recall any hadeeth, why don't you ask him? he's the one who's telling you that : ) The hadeeth I know in Saheeh Al Bukhari from Wael Ibn Hujr that the Prophet Sallallahualiahi wasallam said: &quot;we, the prophets were commanded to put our right hands on our left hands in prayer&quot;. I don't believe there's any hadeeth stronger than this."
Isam Rajab,"Akhi, i already told you if you promise to pay this amount for that job and that job was not done then you don't have to pay unless the employee makes a condition that once the deal is closed he has to take his money regardless of the outcome afterwords."
Isam Rajab,"Ok, we have several issues here. A muslim has the right to do whatever he wants with his merchandise which means he can sell it the price he wishes &quot;as long as there's no &quot;monopoly&quot;. Does the Islamic Country have the right to set the prices to a limit? There are two opinions. Yet, what if it's not a Muslim country or this decission is not fair? This is another issue! I'd like to comment on the word &quot;prespective&quot; since i saw some people using it while talking about Islamic rulings. Islam doesn't have a &quot;prespective&quot; or &quot;point of view&quot; or &quot;opinion&quot;! We as Muslims might have these things, but Islam has rulings and verdicts. The moment we say Islam's point of view or Islam's opinion that means it might be right or wrong and that's true about us but not about Islam."
Isam Rajab,Subhanallah! You accuse someone of misguidance or leaving the way of Ahlussunah only for saying Music is halal? What if he was right and you're wrong? What are the evidences he produced? You already admit that he's a scholar and you're not yet you give yourself the permission to say this about him?   The majority of scholars considered music haram and that's what I believe but that's not an excuse to accuse people of misguidance. Maybe we can say we believe that they're wrong in this issue.  Your effort is to change what you believe is wrong and not attack the person himself especially if he's a scholar.
Isam Rajab,Assalamualaykum At the end of the salah if you remember that you forgot to pray one rakah after you finish the tahasshud wat are you suppose to do...i see ppl doing sujjud wat do you say in the sujjud (subahan rabial a3laa wa bihamdi) or something else..
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If you're asking as an objection then I don't need to answer you. Allah already mentioned several times in the Quran that the jews and christians changed their books, no sane person doubts it including jews and christians themselves.   If you're asking as a clarification then I can answer you but next time please make sure that it's clear in the way you ask. In this incident the jews know what's the ruling of Allah Subhanahu Wata'la and the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam already asked them what's the ruling of it in your book but they lied and they said we only pour tar on their faces and expose them to others. So Allah condemned that and told the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam that the ruling is already there and it's the same as we have it in Islam. Corruption doesn't necessitate that everything is changed."
Isam Rajab,I already answered a similar question. Please take a look at it here:  http://talk.islamicnetwork.com/showthread.php?t=5652
Isam Rajab,"Islam forbids Euthanasia and any other way of ending the life. Allah only has the right to take lives and causes death, no one else. Unfortunately, people sometimes think that they're more merciful than Allah. We tend to forget that we don't own our lives nor our bodies. It's a trust that Allah will take back one day."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I don't understand too how does it work exactly. To my understanding they take a portion of your salary and then after retirement you're paid monthly and there's no problem with this. But according to what you're saying about taking from your savings and then paying back your savings more or less I believe that includes Riba and you can't say you're doing it within yourself because there's a third party involved which is the government. It's true that you don't pay interest for yourself but I believe that's not the case with the scenario you mentioned."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Salat Al Witr is a regular prayer just like any other prayer with the exception that you pray odd Raka't. You could pray one single Raka't and it's still considered Witr prayer. What most people pray is 3. So let's say you wanted to pray 3 Raka't. First you pray two Raka't you read Surat Al Fatiha and Surat Al A'la (This is recommended but not a must) and in the second Raka't you read Surat Al Kafiroun then you do the tashahud and salam. Then you pray one Raka't where you read Al Fatiha and Surat Al Ikhlas or Al Fatiha and Surat al Ikhlas, Surat Al Falaq and Surat Annas.  I'm sorry that I can't really simplify it more, it's just like any other prayer where you pray 2 rak'at and then one rak'at. Sometimes the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam prayed 3 raka't together where he didn't sit except in the last tashahud. But to avoid confusion do the regular prayer now and later on inshallah you could do the other types."
Isam Rajab,If he's asking her to disobey Allah then she doesn't obey him. But if he's asking her not to go to the Masjid then she obeys him.   If the husband is under the influence of a deviant sect then she should advise him not go behind his back.
Isam Rajab,"Assalaamu 'Alaykum,  My husband pronounced Talaq on me for the 3rd time last week.  How soon must I leave the house since I am no longer allowed to be married to him?   Note:  He didn't pronounce all 3 at the same time, the first two times were done over the past two years.  Jazakallah Khair"
Isam Rajab,"Here it's different, since it's not a Masjid and you already prayed then you don't have to. They may pray after some time so they know for sure that you could've prayed in the Masjid but it's still ok to pray with them because you could say the hadeeth is general and not specific to the Masjid."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The first one to enter paradise will be the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam. No doubt about it. However, there are some people who'll get the reward and may enter paradise with their spirits. Just like the martyrs that Allah Subhanahu Wata'la has given them the bodies of birds to enter Jannah. There's no contradiction. The first one to enter Jannah with his body and soul will be the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam."
Isam Rajab,"There are two times, a time for someone who has an excuse as if he was sleeping so he can pray until the sunset. it's very easy nowadays to know exactly when does the sun set.   the other time which is the regular time and that's when the sun starts having the yellow fading light."
Isam Rajab,"It depends on the distance, so one day and one night is measured by 48 miles.   I already answered this question many times."
Isam Rajab,Whether he's chaperone or not. If there's no seclusion between him and non mahram girl then it's permissible. The issue remains whether the girl herself is allowed to travel without a mahram or not and I answered this question several times.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Once a person takes the Shahada and declares sincerely that there's no god but Allah then he's going to be of the people of Jannah and you can't compare him to a non Muslim. However, the Shahada has requirements and conditions should be fulfilled. Also the Muslim is supposed to avoid sins and disobedience to Allah. If he's not then it's up to Allah whether to punish him or forgive him."
Isam Rajab,"All scholars of Fiqh who wrote the big books have a chapter for Bankruptcy! It happened at the time of the Prophet Sallallahualiahi wasallam, and he used to gather the creditors and divide the money according to their shares. If someone had debt for more than one person, and he doesn't have enough money to pay them, so his money will be divided on them according to their shares. This is in general, there are other specific incidents incase you're asking about something in particular."
Isam Rajab,"Ok, now I got it.   The answer is: Yes, there is a magic that makes people go against their will. It's possible to relieve from this type of Magic but it's very difficult without knowing the place of that spell.   Usually the Magician writes something and this thing is hid and it keeps the effects unless this spell is found and burnt or Quran and Athkar are read.   It's much easier to protect yourself with Quran and Athkar so if you recite the daily athkar and you read Quran especially Surat Al Baqara and the last two suras of the Quran then no one can harm you.   Let's say you know someone who's effected by Magic, could he seek help from other people? and the answer is yes he could but the people who'll help him should not use magic or any unlawful method."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Suspision only is not enough. If you don't see anything then it's pure."
Isam Rajab,"as-salam alykoom,  Sheikh, there is a famous nasheed praising the prophet where the singer says &quot;Ya Mustafa.&quot;  Can one say Ya Mustafa or is saying &quot;ya {name}&quot; reserved only for Allah?  Barak Allah feek wa jazak Allah khair"
Isam Rajab,"Ok, now I get it : )  Is that you Abu Ilyaas?   Well, if you add hair then you can't do it because the Messenger Sallallahualihi wasallam cursed the one who does it, but if it's the same hair then it's ok I don't see any evidance forbids that."
Isam Rajab,If he's unable to afford marriage at all then he should be patient and not marry because that's what the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam stipulated. But if he's able to afford marriage yet he still needs some help then in this case he should go ahead because the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam promised that Allah will help the one who wants to marry. Now you can judge better inshallah.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, I don't know this hadith."
Isam Rajab,"i have heard that men and women are supposed to remove the hair under their arms and also the hair in their private areas or that it should not be longer than a rice grain.  but i also heard that if the hair is not properly maintained, wudu is not complete.  is this true?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   If you notarize your will then by law they'll do that. I suggest that you inform the Islamic Center in your area also."
Isam Rajab,Assalam-o-Alaikum   if i wanted can i go to hajj in women group when no mehram can go with me?will Allah accept it from me?  girl who is not married is there any kind of restriction on her going all by herself for hajj in women group?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikumassalam,   In general it's allowed to use birth controls for both genders temporarely because the companions used to do that to avoid pregnancy but you can't do that permenately since the prophet sallallahulaiahi wasallam encouraged muslims to reproduce.   Allah guaranteed the provision for parents and children so this should not be a reason for using birth controls, they have to trust Allah Subhanahu wata'ala."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum,  If someone having her periods but she is willing to fast on the 10 Muharram. Can she fast? Her fasting will be valid ???  Jazak Allah Khair  Asalamo  alikum"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Allah says in the Quran {Ask the people of knowledge if you don't know}. Allah didn't tell everybody to extract the rulings and derive the lessons directly from the book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam. People are different and they act according to their ability. So if someone doesn't have the knowledge then he should ask, even if the one who answered him was wrong it's not the fault of the questioner. If someone has the ability and the knowledge then he should find the ruling himself."
Isam Rajab,If he wants to marry her then it's permissible to get her father's contact information to talk to him. But I wonder why the mother and the sister refuses to help him. I don't think a marriage without the mother's consent will be a blessed marriage unless she's disobedient or disbeliever and the girl is righteous. I advise the brother first to fix the matter with his family before he proposes to any girl.
Isam Rajab,shayk i was doing an interview in a room with non-mahram women and you could see threw the windows of the door   is this permissable?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   The purpose of Tajweed is to be able to recite the Quran correctly, so you don't have to knwo this is Idgham or Ikhfa as long as you do it.   You have to learn how to recite the Quran properly. Imam Ibn Aljazari mandates that and cosniders the one who doesn't recite it correctly a sinner."
Isam Rajab,"What do you do if your family is pressuring you into marry someone that you don't think you are compatible with ?  They say that I will learn to love him for who he is after I get married. Also, they do not want to look for someone for me they would rather wait for men to ask for my hand. This process takes way to long and I am growing impatient and they will not allow me to look or ask another for help. They say its not proper. I have told them that it is ok for a girl to initiate marriage and there should not be any shame. I learned this from a shayk.  But they continue to argue.  I hate upseting them but I feel like I will never get married or I'll get married when its too late.   salamuelaikum"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Although she named you as executor yet it seems that she divided the money as inheritance since you're three and she gave each one of you one third, therefore I don't encourage you to take the money because of the Hadith. Yet you could tell your brothers that you won't take the money but they can give you some of it and in that case it becomes a gift not inheritance."
Isam Rajab,"The hadeeth of Abu Huraira includes many authentic narrations and some weak ahadeeth as well. If we just reject the hadeeth according to our desire then it's a grave sin.   I advise you to remind her with the duty of a Muslim which is to follow the Messenger Sallahualiahi wasallam, if she didn't respond then I advise you to leave her as soon as possible, there's no good in someone who doesn't honor the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam.   It's true that sometimes in some occasions the hadeeth might be authentic but not necessarely said by the messenger sallalalhuliahi wasallam, but this is to the scholars of hadeeth to determin not the ignorant or lay people."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam alaykum wa rahmatulahi wa barakatu,      Often times we see people ask questions regarding the royal &quot;WE&quot; as it is called by some.  This is where Allah Subhanahu wa t'ala refers to himself as &quot;We&quot; in the quran.  Al Hamdulilah, the answer regarding this is clear, but what is the correct answer regarding certian ayas in the quran when Allah subuhanahu wa t'ala refers to himself in the third person such as &quot;He&quot;?  For example in the Sura 33:42 it says &quot;Glorify &quot;him&quot; morning and evening&quot;  as aposed to &quot;Glorify me&quot; and also in the next verse 33:43 &quot;He&quot; it is who sends blessings on you, as do his angels, that he may bring you out from the depths of darkness into light:and HE is full of mercy to the believers.&quot;  There are many more verses like this where Allah subhanahu wa t'ala refers to himself as &quot;he&quot; as apposed to saying &quot;I&quot; or &quot;We&quot;.  Is this where Allah subhanahu wa t'ala is speaking directly or is this an aya where Allah Subhanau wa t'ala has chosen words for Jibril Alayhe Salam to say and that is why Allah subhanuhu wa t'ala is reffered to as &quot;he&quot;?  Please shed some light on this question.  Jazakalahu Khar.  Asalam Alaykim wa rahmatulahi wa barakatu."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If this sister deserves the Zakat then yes you can give her a Zakat as a gift, but if she doesn't deserve the Zakat then you can't give her this gift as a Zakat money but you could give it to her as a gift and you still have to pay your Zakat."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes it's permissible, and yes Ibn Al Qayim mentioned that it's useful and it was experienced several times. Since you're allowed to do Ruqya with Al Fatiha, then you can read it on water and drink the water.  I wished if someone else asked this question, because you already know that in principle performing Ruqya is permissible as long as it doesn't include shirk and you don't need a proof to perform Ruqya but you need a proof to forbid it. You already studied that!"
Isam Rajab,"Salamu 'alaikum wa rahmatu Allahi wa barakatuh   What is the ruling on muslims who gossip about another muslima? And what should the muslima do if she knows about this gossip, that is being spread about her? Even thou she Loves the sisters for Allahs sake and she needs the hasana, should she keep distance?   Inshaa Allah you could advise this sister bc maybe they don't know it but it is hurting her feelings.  Baraka Allahu feek  asSalamu 'alaikum"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, You could say Subhana rabialla'la three times up to ten times. Then you could say as much dua as you want, that's the place where you are nearer to Allah Subhanahuwata'la so you don't have to say a specific dua, yet the Messenger Sallallahualihai wasallam used to say few duas, of them the one that the Messenger Sallallahualihai wasallam taught to Abu Bakr:   اللهم إني ظلمت نفسي ظلماً كثيراً ولا يغفر الذنوب إلا أنت فاغفر لي مغفرة من عندك وارحمني إنك أنت الغفور الرحيم"
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh,  I hear people making comments such as 'women are permitted to wear trousers so long as its loose' and then i've heard others say, it is not permissible to wear trousers even it is loose because one can see the gap between your leg when you walk. I'm confused, i wear long jilbab or skirt but would like to improve my understanding on the matter.  May Allah (subhana wa ta'ala) bestow rahma upon you and your family"
Isam Rajab,"In principle, there's no evidence to forbid that, especially if a woman wanted to strengthen her hair. Unless it's used to copy the disbelieving women or to imitate the men. In both cases it's forbidden. Other than that, there's no evidence to forbid it."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam warahmatullahi wabarakatuh,   Scholars divide talking in prayer to 4 types.   In general, anything outside the prayer you say in the prayer for no need then it's not permissible and it's going to invalidate your Salat. &quot;Remember that you're standing before Allah&quot; So if you have complaints form them in a way of Dua."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I don't know any hadith forbids eating in the Masjid. So it's permissible to eat there unless it'll lead to disrespecting the Masjid then it becomes forbidden not because you can't eat but because it's a disrespect to the Masjid."
Isam Rajab,"No, the guidance of Allah is not arbitrary. It's as I told you in my response to your first quesion, who deserves guidence will be guided, but whoever refuses then he'll be lead astray. As Allah says 41:17 {And as for Thamud, We gave them guidance, but they preferred blindness to the guidance, so the bolt of the doom of humiliation overtook them because of what they used to earn}. So when people reject the truth and refuse gudience they'll be led astray.   Guidance has many levels, there's a guidance of Allah to all creatures including animals to know where to find their food, to the infants how they drink the milk... And there's guidance of the Messengers in a sense that they tell the people what's right and what's wrong and there's a guidance from Allah to make the people respond and accept the truth.   Allah says 28:56 {Verily! You (O Muhammad SAW) guide not whom you like, but Allah guides whom He wills} Allah says 42: 52 {And verily, you (O Muhammad SAW) are indeed guiding (mankind) to the Straight Path}  To a narrow minded person, this seems contradiction. But to a person who has a sane mind I'm sure he'll understand it."
Isam Rajab,Could you please tell me what do you mean by hoors?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   Allah says: { O you who believe! Let not a people of you mock other people; perhaps they are better than them, and let not women make fun of other women for the latter may be better than them}. So in general yes sarcasm is prohibited."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Al Mahdi is a title for a man with a name muhammand ibn abdullah or ahmad ibn abdullah. He's from the lineage of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam.   The best thing you could do is to listen to 4 cd set by Yasir Qadhi. They're sufficient in this matter. You'll find it here:  http://www.ilmquest.org/p-343-the-ma...ion-4-cds.aspx"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Tawba if it was made correctly erases the sins and the trace of it, so the black dot will be removed as the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam said.   If someone asks about a particular thing whether you repented or not, you don't lie but you tell the person that it's not their business. Don't give them a chance to ask you from the beginning, but if they did, then make it clear to them that Allah is the only one who will judge you."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   This hadith means that being dutiful to your mother is a means to enter paradise, and yes it includes every mother. You have to be dutiful to her. But that doesn't mean you obey her if she asks you to disobey Allah Subhanahu Wata'la."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's true that as long as you're a Muslim then you have something good, but we don't take whatever we like and leave whatever we dislike. We have to take Islam as a whole. When she talks to people about Islam and they find out that she's not adhering to what she's preaching then she'll lose her credibility.    It's your duty to make dua for her, that's the least you can do for her."
Isam Rajab,Asalamu alaikum   what is the ruling on Juma'ah? and is it better to sit where your prayed your sunnah in the masjid and listen to the Khubah and is talking during Khutbuh invalidate your prayer?  wasalam
Isam Rajab,"if somone passed in front of u in ur fardh or sunnah prayers and u wernt able to stop them, does it mean u have to repeat ur salaah? should u break the salaah straight away and start again?  barrakallaahu feek"
Isam Rajab,"Aslam U Alikum  Sheikh , i was reading your questiong regarding Missing sujood. I have the problem that many many times i guess every day .. when i m praying i just forget how many sujood i have done or i get a doubt and this doubt is not only in this , its in rakah and also sometimes i read surah fatihah or not.  So what i do is completely ignore this doubts and just do what i m certain without worrying about and try to concentrate as much as i can, i have tried soo much to concentrate and even I am concentrating these things happen.  I am not sure what should i do when i get into doubt with thsees one sujood or unknown rakah when i m praying??"
Isam Rajab,is the voice of the sis awrah for brother to hear...what i mean is that can a sister for exampl talk to brother in mic that means this bro is not her huhram...or a good example paltalk room (islamic roms) what dose islam say about this? is not ok yes/no..if yes plzz give me prooof ayah ot hadiith ...if not what do u advice that sister?  jazakumlahu khairan
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, I don't know of any evidence states that you should bury them. The narrations actually proves otherwise. When the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam went to answer the call of nature he asked not to be given a bone which means the bones were apparent because if it was buried then they can't get it unless they know where it was buried. Also the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam advised the companions to use the skin of the animal and they told him it's dead and he said what's forbidden is its meat."
Isam Rajab,"the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said: the best of your days: Juma, on it adam was created, admitted to paradise, sent down to earth, died, and on it the day of judgment will occur."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum,  There are 4 sunnah before 4 fardh in Zuhr prayer. Can you pray like 2 sunnah, then 4 fardh, then again 2 sunnah instead of offering 4 sunnah before 4 fardh?  Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,can a woman change haer dress daily duing hajj days?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It came from more than thirty or so Ahadeeth! it's not one or two hadeeth! But there are very few places where the prophet sallallahualiai wasallam didn't raise his hands just like when he prays in the khutba on friday."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamualiakum,  I heard this before, and i heard also that the cave is in Syria! 3 years ago I was visiting Turkey with my wife, so they took us to a place and they said here's the cave that's mentioned in the Quran! so Allah knows best which one is the right one. remember that Allah subhanahu wata'ala mentioned lots of details about their story, yet he didn't mention the place of the cave, and Allah subhanahu wata'la doesn't neglect anything without a reason, since it's not mentioned, that means it's not important where is it. therefore, I don't recommend visiting it unless you want to go for fun   not to increase your iman."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, I didn't get the question! If the Imam finished prayer then people should wait little bit because maybe there's something, if that's what you meant then yes, because when people at the time of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam left quickly they thought the prayer was shortened so scholars said it's recommended to wait for a while and then you can leave."
Isam Rajab,"Al-Salamu Alaikum:  &quot;And it has already been revealed to you in the Book (this Quran) that when you hear the Verses of Allah being denied and mocked at, then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that; (but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them. Surely, Allah will collect the hypocrites and disbelievers all together in Hell,&quot;  (Quran 4:140)  My questions regarding this ayah are the following:  1. Does this ayah apply to those kuffar who deny Allah, The Quran, Islam and The Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him)? e.g. Kuffar Claiming Jesus (Peace Be Upon Him) is the son of God (astaghfurallah)? Kuffar denying the existence of Allah (astaghfurallah)? Kuffar claiming that the Quran is &quot;incomplete&quot; or a &quot;false book&quot; (astaghfurallah)? Denying The Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) is a Prophet? Cursing him or Allah (astaghfurallah)?  2. Does it apply to Muslims who either intentionally or unintentionally say words of kufr? (e.g. Calling Islam &quot;backwards&quot; or that the Muslim's mentality is &quot;backwards&quot;).  3. Does it apply for example, to people who write articles defending Islam but quote what people whether they be Muslim or Non-Muslim say atttacking Islam in order to respond to their attacks? Or to expose them?  4. Does it apply when someone says &quot;Holy (whatever)&quot; whatever being a swear word or anything else?  Please answer each point one by one because I need clarification of these examples."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If the pregnant woman can't fast or fears if she fast she'll endanger the baby's life or health then she doesn't have to fast and she can make it up later."
Isam Rajab,"Are we allowed to be friends with Hindus  ?  I tried giving them dawah but they don't care about religion. They still ask me to come over and hang out but I don't really want to. Is it ok for me to break of ties ?   Also, if a muslim person rejects the companions of the Prophet (saas)...can we remain friends with them ?  jzk"
Isam Rajab,"salaam shaikh,  just have a question about isbaal.  is isbaal haram completely, or just if it is done out of pride and arrogancce?? and wouldd it be considered a major or minor sin??  jazakallah"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I can't give specific details since I don't know exactly what's going on but I could tell you first you need to be more positive. Don't say every decision I make is wrong, or everything became worse. You need to change that attitude even if it's difficult. Remember that the matter could really get worse and worse and you don't want that. Once you thank Allah Subhanahu Wata'la for what's happening, the matter will become easy inshallah. sometimes people are having difficulties in their lives as a reminder from Allah Subhanahu Wata'la so they may stop sinning. Sometimes it's a test from Allah Subhanahu Wata'la for the strong believers. Thing of the other good things that are going on and this will help you inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"Giving away money/clothes or anything in charity on behalf of deceased person, Is it permissible?"
Isam Rajab,"The hadeeth you quoted is about a woman who's previously married. Scholars differentiate between the virgin and non virign woman.   If she's young, the father can force her according to some schools of thought. if she's married before, then the father can't force her and the Nikah is null. So she doesn't have to do anything because there's no Nikah at the first place, even if she's pleased with it later on &quot;according to Imam Ahmad&quot;."
Isam Rajab,"I think you didn't quote the hadeeth correctly. The deeds are presented on Monday and Thursday &quot;not Thursday and Friday&quot;.   This is not the only hadeeth the Messenger Sallallahu aliahi wasallam mentioned about brotherhood. the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam said also that it's forbiddent not to talk to your brother for more than 3 dyas, and it's forbidden also to desert him or propose to a lady after your brother did so. It's the right of the muslim upon other muslims to say the salam, follow the funeral, and so on. So this hadeeth basically forbids the animosity towards other muslims and shows the severe punishment for that which is the deprevation of forgiveness. We may differ and argue with one another, but we should never have rancor or hatred towards our brothers. The companions differed and disagreed on many issues and even fought themeselves yet they didn't have hatred."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   So if you don't have khushu and laugh, you'll have khushu in the second prayer? I really don't get it!   I'm very sorry I don't mean to be offensive and I'm trying my best to answer your questions but I'm worried now about the way you're dealing with your religious issues, I really advise you to see an Imam or a specialist since this is not normal at all.  May Allah help you."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, There are two issues here: 1) Using this pill whether it's permissible or not? And I think it's too early now to judge because maybe it has side effects on the private part or other harmful consequences.    2) The ruling on stimulation without discharge. If we say it's permissible to use this pill and someone used it without the private parts meet and there was no discharge then the ghusl is not mandatory because the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam made the condition &quot;If you saw wetness&quot;."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If that blood came during the regular time of period then it's of her period, but if it came in another time then it depends:  If she has a regular period then she doesn't count this and she considers only her regular period thus she makes up the prayer.  Or, if she can distinguish between the blood of her period and the regular blood then she looks at that blood if it's thick and dark then it's of her period and she can't pray, but if not then she has to make up these days and she considers this blood as a regular blood."
Isam Rajab,Aslam U Alikum Sheikh as you mentioned  in other question you cant eat chicken who has been feed with haram things. But now a days almost everywhere chicken and goat are fed that way and so we should avoid all the chicken and meat in North America atleast?  Jazakallah kher
Isam Rajab,"What is the ruling concering going to college and taking out student loans which, after 6 months of graduation are not paid back in full, incur interest? What if there is no other way for one to go to college? If one has exhausted all other efforts (ie applied for grants, scholarships, asked people for money, etc) and finds no other option to attend school, is it permissible to take these loans just for the sole purpose of going to college and being able to provide for his or her family?"
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum,  Shaikh you said that &quot;as long as you avoid black color&quot; I wanted to know what this black thing is all about? Why you have to avoid black color. What is the reason behind this.   I shall be thankful to you if you answer my question.  Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Isha time starts when the twilight is already gone or as you said when there's complete darkness and that's when they call the Athan of Isha. So you can't pray before it. If they delay the call then you can pray before the Athan. The issue is not when they call for the prayer but when does the time start?"
Isam Rajab,HI im 18 yrs old... and was wondering if masturbation is haraam or not?
Isam Rajab,"salam alaikum sheikh  My problem is that i get very annoyed by some actions that my muslim friends do, even if they seem small but since i meet them on a regular basis, it sort of builds up. And i sometimes complain to myself about them or get upset while im alone, and dont ever bring my displeasment with them becuase i know its only gonna start fitna and not bring any benefit so i instead just keep it all inside of me but i still slip into (sort of cursing/backbiting) them for myself, is this considered a sin?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If the judge issued the Khul' and then the divorce is out of place. But if you decided that you'll go ahead and do the khul' then the husband decided to divorce then it's valid."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You need to understand the hadeeth first and know what happened exactly before you establish any conviction.   Here in this hadeeth the woman was married but the man was unmarried, so the unmarried is punished differently than the married. There's no difference whether it's male or female.   The aya you mentioned about keeping the female inside the house is abrogated."
Isam Rajab,"assalam o alaikum i am the chair of an islamic project at a christian university.  the majority of the &quot;muslims&quot; oncampus follow the ismaili tradition of agha khan.  becaue my group is an academic group that focuses on erasing the misconceptions of islam by teaching the realities and truth from the Quaran and Sunnah i tend to stay away from all factionalism amongst Muslims.  the ismaili students oncampus have been trying to breach the limits that ive set.  i do not want to disclude them because if someone tells me they are Muslim, it is not my place to decide how righteous or practicing of a Muslim they are.  however, they want to bring in Ismaili philosophy and teach topics like women, jihad, and tawheed based on it.  this really puts me a bad position because their thoughts are very different from what is found in the Quaran.  How should i go about dealing with the Ismaili students because i dont want to alienate them but i dont want them saying anything about Islam that isnt accurate or biased. Jazakallah Khair."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   Dua in sujud includes both Fard and Nafl, no difference."
Isam Rajab,Can a man have intimate relations with both his wives together?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Asalam,   Uloohiyah refers to Ilah &quot;God&quot;, Uboodiyah refers to Ibada &quot;Worship&quot;. In Aqeeda they're the same. To single out Allah in worship."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah, I don't think the title you chose for your question is subitable and it doesn't fit your question. You don't need to do anything with the dead fish, but it's better to be a good doer in everything and maybe you're able to feed that fish to a cat and you'll be rewarded for that but even if you dumped it in the garbage or flushed it in the toilet there's no sin on you."
Isam Rajab,"The Ayat of the Quran are clear Arabic speech, no argument about that. Yet, that doesn't mean everybody knows everything and all the meanings. Otherwise, there's no difference between a scholar and an ignorant and all Arab will be scholars simply because they know Arabic! If you want to understand this Ayah 3:7 then read it fully, don't pick and choose, Allah is telling you that in this miraculas book there are words that could be understood by everybody, by many, by only the scholars and there are words that their reality couldn't be perceived save Allah. When Allah tells us that he rose over his throne, we know what's the meaning of rising over a throne, but we don't know the reality of it because we're creatures and AlMighty God is a creator. When Allah tells us about his hand, we know what's the meaning of a hand but we don't know the reality of it in regards to our creator becasuse even the creatures themselves they have many different hands while they're all creatures."
Isam Rajab,The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam used to pray aprox. one third of the night which is 4 hours sometimes and 2 hours sometimes and in between sometimes.   Why you limit your options to two only! Whether two raka'h or 11? Why don't you pray 4 average raka'h and you pray witr then? that's better in your case. Maitaining the number itself (11) is not better than praying a lengthy prayer as Aisha Radiallahu Anha said: &quot;Don't ask about their lenght and beauty!&quot;.
Isam Rajab,Yes you leave the prayer if it's optional and respond to your parents unless you know it's ok with them if later on they knew that you're in prayer then you don't leave it. The strong opinion is that you restart the prayer instead of continuing it but there's an opinion that you can continue the prayer as long as the gap was not long.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes it could be jinn and it could be something else! It's very difficult to judge without physical presence. Some scholars considered the one who doesn't pray a disbeliever. Other scholars said he's committing a major sin but he's still muslim.  If the preson recites Quran once he wakes up, eats 7 dates, performs wudu, reads the thikr and starts prayer then there's no power on earth will stop him."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum wa rehmatullahi wa barakatu,  Some scholars say that Prophet Mohammad Sallalaho Alaihi wasallam was born on 12th Rab-ul-Awwal. While the other scholars say that he was born on 9th Rabi-ul-Awwal.   I am confused. When was he actually born?  Asalam o alikum wa rehmatullahi wa barakatu"
Isam Rajab,"Is it permissible for a woman to hug her father in-law? For example, when the woman comes back from another country."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   You recite the Basmala secretly if you perform the Wudu in the &quot;Restroom&quot;, usually there's a difference between the Wudu Area and the Restroom, so if the Wudu Area is separate then you say it aloud.    We don't say any thikr in the lavatory, we say before we enter and after we leave."
Isam Rajab,"Assalaamu Alaykum,  I am just wondering if it is permissible to accept items/gifts from others (muslims and non-muslims) without asking them if they obtained these items/gifts through halal or haram means/wealth.  Must one always ask? Also, if it is known that obtained them via haram wealth, is it still permissible to accept these items/gifts from them?  BarakAllaahu Feekum."
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu Alaikum ya shaykh  Is it makrooh to have intercourse with your pregnant wife? Is that what this hadith means?  揇o not have intercourse with a pregnant woman until she gives birth, or with one who is not pregnant until she has menstruated once.?Narrated by Abu Dawood, 2157. al-Haafiz Ibn Hajar said in al-Talkhees al-Habeer (1/171,172): Its isnaad is hasan."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   There's a weak hadeeth says that if you keep sleeping after Asr and you loose your mind then blame yourself only. That's why scholars disliked sleeping after Asr, but again the hadeeth is not authentic."
Isam Rajab,It's ok to give the Christian family Zakat money especially if it'll help them learning about Islam more.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes the hadeeth means don't sell what you don't own. But I still say in your case it's permissible with one condition: If you fail to provide the good then you return the money."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's better to forgive them and Allah Subhanahu Wata'la will reward you. Remember how many people wronged the Messenger Sallallahualahi wasallam yet he forgave them. I know it's very easy to say this but it's very hard to do it and only few people do it yet try to be better than them. Taht's what Yusuf peace be upon him told his brothers after they wronged him for years. You don't have to do Khul' (Please check the previous answer)."
Isam Rajab,It depends on that firm what they do exactly. If you're a third party where you get deals from big companies then you sell it to individuals then it's permissible as long as the firm is dealing with haram.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If they look like living objects then it's forbidden even if they themselves don't exist. If they don't look like living objects then it's permissible. so in the example you mentioned I say it's forbidden because it looks like cat."
Isam Rajab,Asalamu Alaikum  Is it considered if you tell someone how the other person has harmed you? For example so and so humuliated me or yelled at me or hit me. I think I read somewhere that you can't backbite unless you have been treated unjustly?
Isam Rajab,"There's nothing wrong with celebrating a national day, it doesn't get the religious status, so it's not haram. However, because thanksgiving is a pure non muslim event, I fear it might be somehow considered as copying them. Other than that, there's nothing wrong with it."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   As long as the Imam covers his Awara and his shoulders then all scholars agreed that the prayer is correct. Yet that doesn't mean it's fine to be in the stated mentioned above, the Imam is an example for other Muslims, he can play and have fun but to come directly from playing while sweatting and lead the Muslims. This is not appropriate at all. The Imam reminds people that they're standing before Allah Subhanahu Wata'la so they better be in their best outfit. You could advise the Imam with this and remind him that he's a leader and he should lead them with his actions not only sayings."
Isam Rajab,"salamu alaikum, I have noticed that if I start doing somehting and when it becomes a habit I don't explicitly think about the intention.  What I mean here is that I had a hard time in controlling my anger, and I would get mad at people every now and then.  To improve my situation, whenever someone would make me mad, I began saying, &quot;OK, i have to control my anger, for the sake of Allah&quot; and would think about the reward. Now, alhamdulilah, I have been improving and it is coming naturally and I don't have to think &quot;OK, i have to control my anger, for the sake of Allah&quot;.  Would I still be rewarded for something that is coming automatically?"
Isam Rajab,My friend's away at a place with no internet access. His e-mail account would expire if he doesn't check it soon. I've his password but I'm not able to contact him. Is it ok if I use his password to log onto his e-mail so it doesn't expire? There's important stuff in his e-mail I'm sure he'd want to keep.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The woman who knows that she's going to the market and she'll miss the prayer is committing a sin. We don't fall into disobeying Allah Subhanahu Wata'la and then we try to find a solution. So if a woman were to go to the market she has to make sure that she'll be able to perform the prayer on time on the ground. If you have someone who has knowledge and you already asked him please don't ask again. This is one of the rules that is repeated several times in this forum."
Isam Rajab,"bismillah... Assalamu alaikum shaykh,  inshaAllah you are in the best of health and emaan. At what age can you not carry a kid while praying?   masalama"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I don't know, it depends on his inention. Ya Allah cure me means O Allah! Cure me, this is a dua and it's recommended but if he means that O Allah! cure me quickly I've been sick for long time then yes he should show patience."
Isam Rajab,"You should ask whether there's a reliable opinion to make it prohibited or not! If you're talking about this instrument (dhol) then I'm not sure if it's music or not. In principle, all musical instruments are forbidden but I still can't determin whether this one is also a musical instrument or not. I agree it's better not to play it and stick with the duff but I don't have an evidence to forbid this one.  It becomes your duty to tell the people not to come once you believe that it's prohibited and you have an evidence for that."
Isam Rajab,"Can you please list the characteristics of a woman who is an 'evil wife' as mentioned in ahadith or athar?  Secondly, what constitutes &quot;su'ul-akhlaq&quot;?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   You have to make up the Salat if you're not sure. You're certain that you didn't pray but you have a doubt that you probably prayed so you have to do it again. There's a major rule in Islam says certainty is not removed by doubt."
Isam Rajab,Are Muslims allowed to wear garments madae of human hair?
Isam Rajab,"Asalam Alaykum, In order for a person to be engaged, do they have to be wearing the ring, or is it as soon as the father gives the man the o.k? And can they talk to eachother or no?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes it's haram. It doesn't happen without disobeying Allah. Allah guided us to follow His book and His Messenger if there's a dispute not to summon the jinn!"
Isam Rajab,I don't mind. But I'm more aware of the Arabic editions than the English ones.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh, I never heard of such a hadith and I can't say anything unless I know it but most likely there's no such a hadith because at the time of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam it was never reported that women wore trousers! So I suspect such a hadith. In general, if the Abayah that you were covers the color and the shape of your body then that's it you don't have to wear anything else."
Isam Rajab,"Aslam U Alikum Shaikh  If a person takes a Guhsl after intercourse with wife and during taking ghusl he felt that something came out from anus, do you have to start your ghusl again because the thing he felt may be left out mainy? or just ignore because he doesn't know what exactly it is?..  Jazakallah kher"
Isam Rajab,"Aslam U Alikum i just wanted to know what is the qiblah in North America  , some people say its south east and some say its norht east? but seems like almost all mosque follow North east? so i was just confused about the whole situation.  Secondly how to determine qiblah by just making straight line on the map or taking in consideration the curvature?  Jazakallah kher"
Isam Rajab,"Asaalam Alaaikum Waa Rahmaatullah Wa Baraakatuh  Some of the people use this program within themselves for fun, where when they speak on the mike, they can sound like the opposite gender... Even if the people know they are using this program, would this constitute as imitating the opposite gender?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's recommended to start with two short raka' and recite whatever you want. Then you pray long Raka't. whether 6 or 8. Then you pray witr. You pray 2 raka' and then you make salam, you read surat Al-Ala and Surt Al-Kafiroon, then the last raka' you read surat Al-Ikhlas. Or you could pray 3 raka' together and you sit only at the end for tashahud. You can read any surat you want, there's no specific surat that you have to read, it's just a recommendation.   Also the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam sometimes prayed 7 rak'a together with only one tashahud at the end and sometimes 5. In Tahajjud it's up to you. People tend to focus on the recitation and forget the thikr during Ruku and Sujud while the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam used to prolong them as well."
Isam Rajab,"How would Allah bless them without Islam? It's totally appropriate to tell them that this is what you do in your religion for someone who sneezes. It could be a good opportunety to start a conversation about Islam.  If you intend that they'll be blessed by Islam then it's ok but they are going to get the wrong impression because you didn't tell them that, you just intended it so I don't encourage it."
Isam Rajab,I can't say it was known but some used to keep special cloak only for Qiamullail to put it on before Allah Subhanahu Wata'la. So that should be the case whether in the Masjid or alone since you're standing before Allah Subhanahu Wata'la.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, Yes it's true. But 7 people means 7 households and one sheep means one household. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam sacrifices only one sheep although he had more than one wife."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   They give the same meaning, bucause sunnah is not an obligatory act and the nafl has the same definition. However, usually sunnah is what the Prophet Sallallahualaihi Wasallam maintained doing other than the obligatories like the sunnah of subh and sunnah of maghrib and so on, while nafl is any other prayer that's performed in a different time."
Isam Rajab,"Book 36, Number 4266 sunan abu dawood:  Narrated Jabir ibn Samurah:   &quot;The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: The religion will continue to be established till there are twelve caliphs over you, and the whole community will agree on each of them. I then heard from the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) some remarks which I could not understand. I asked my father: What is he saying: He said: all of them will belong to Quraysh. &quot;  can u mention these caliphs?"
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum ,  one of my brother's friend told me brother that everything under sea is halal. I just wanted to make sure if it true or not. Can you mention the names of the under sea animals which are halal for us?   Jazak Allah Khair  Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu Alaikum, Is it true it is haraam for a girl or a woman to wear kuhl, or kajal (for desis) until they get married?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The Majority of schoalrs say if she's praying 21 obligatory prayers &quot;4 days&quot; in the same place then she's not traveler."
Isam Rajab,"Salamu alaikum  I am a mother who is homeschooling her children. The education materials I have often require the child to do things whose permissibility I am doubtful of. I know that children can play with dolls (animate beings) but can you clarify if a small child can do the following:  - dot to dot (where the child joins the dots to make a picture, practising their pencil control) of animate beings like humans or animals (does it make a difference if the eyes are there, or if the child crosses the eyes out? I've heard that if there are no eyes, it is not considered a 'surah') - colouring in animate beings (the picture is also drawn/printed and the child simply colours it in; does it make a difference again regarding the eyes) - drawing the outline of animate beings but without the eyes  There are many 'Islamic' colouring books but I always feel doubtful about this. Is the ruling different for a parent/adult assisting or demonstrating what to do, for the child?  jazakAllah khayr"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Just when you look up in the sky. The exact meaning is the line that you see between the sky and the earth."
Isam Rajab,"Yes it's obvious that these are two different answers. But it's clear if you give just a little bit more thought ( Not much). The story is not that Lot Peace be upon him came and he told them you should worship one god and abandon what you're doing and they said no and that's it. If that's the story then yes there may be contradiction. But Lot peace be upon him have spoken to them several times - just like what we have nowadays when you show people evidence after evidence and they play games everytime- first they told him bring upon us the wrath of Allah, then when they saw that he's determined to convey the Message they inteded to drive him and his people out of the city. So again, there's no contradiction."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Yes they are mahrams."
Isam Rajab,"This hadeeth is narrated by most of people of Sunan such as &quot;Imam Attirmithi, Abu Dawood , Imam Ahmad&quot; rahimahumullah. The hadeeth is authntic, yet it's abrogated! All scholars agreed that this hadeeth is not applicable. The Messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam didn't do it himself, nor anyone of the Khulafa after him did it. At the time of the Prophet sallallahu aliahi wasallam, there was a man who used to drink alcohol, and used to be punished for that several times, yet he was not executed! Imam Alshafie rahimahullah said after this hadeeth: I don't know anybody who says this hadeeth is not abrogated! Imam Ibn Hajar al Asqalani -who interpreted Sahih Al bukhari- has a useful elaboration on this matter in volume 12 chapter of Punishments."
Isam Rajab,Yes I remember this hadith. It's narrated by Ahmad and Attirmithi from Abdillah Ibn Amr. It's also in Sahih Ibn Hibban but this hadith doesn't pertain to the newly muslims only. It's for everybody. It basically says that for everything there's a peak and there's a time of weakness. But the one who still worships Allah during the time of weakness is the one who's on the straight path.   I don't know exactly what do you want to know about this hadith?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   I'm not clear what makes it different from the regular phone?"
Isam Rajab,"I don't recall any incident from the time of the companions where they used to stop for chit chat. Talking itself between the two genders doesn't have ruling. It depends on the nature of the talk itself, whether it's for medication, selling or other things. If the only purpose for talking is just to talk! then it's not allowed, although there's no aya or hadeeth forbids that clearly, yet it's understood from the texts of the Quran and the Sunnah that this will open the doors for Satan to incite them to disobey Allah. in the Quran 24:31 Allah instructs women to lower their gaze and guard their modesty.  Even when the woman wants to obey Allah, it's better for her always to do so in her house as the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamualaykum Ya Sheikh I hope this reaches you in good health and increading imaan. I know that having a credit card is haraam b/c you pay annual interest. I was wondering if its ok to have those that dont have any annual interest. What if you use the credit card to buy things online, simply bc thats all they ask for, and you only buy it if you have the money therefore as soon as you charge it on your card you pay the money without waiting for the 28days to incur interest. Walaykumulsalam"
Isam Rajab,You can say ANY Dua in Sujud in ANY language as long as you said Subhana rabial a'la.
Isam Rajab,You can pray Asr with the Jamaah but you don't have to since you already prayed it jointly with Thuhr and if you pray you'll get inshallah the reward of nafl prayer.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You pray the missing prayer the moment you remember it or the moment you're able to do it. That's what the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said. &quot;Whoever slept or forgot a prayer he should pray it once he remembers it, there's no compensation except that&quot;. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam didn't say unless it's a fajr prayer, so it should be the same."
Isam Rajab,To Allah we belong and to him we shall return. إنا لله وإنا إليه راجعون
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's also the sayings and actions of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam! A woman came to him asking him about making up fasting on behalf of her mother who passed away. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam didn't tell her: Yes make up the fast. He told her: What if she owed a debt to someone, wouldn't you pay it off? She said yes, so he siad: then it's more appropriate to pay off the debt of Allah.   In another incedent, a man came to the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam complaining about a baby his wife delivered and he doesn't look like him! So the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam asked him if he had any camels and if has any camel with a different color, and the man said yes I have, so the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam asked him why this camel's color is different? the man said maybe it's a gene (race) so the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam told him the same thing about his son. Also there are numerous incedents where the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam used Qias. And scholars said only the insaine who can deny Qias."
Isam Rajab,"You should not compliment something people are disobeying Allah Subhanahu Wata'la with. So if a sister's hair looks nice you shouldn't praise her for that because even if it's really nice this is disobedience to Allah Subhanahu Wata'la, but you could say instead: Your hair, make-up looks great had it not been a disobedience. Things even if they seem nice as long as Islam doesn't approve them.   This ruling is for both muslims and non muslims, you don't praise what people are doing while they're disobeying Allah Subhanahu Wata'la, but for non muslims you could still praise them if you're using this as a reminder or a tool of Dawah."
Isam Rajab,"Salaam u alaikum  is it permissable for my wife to call me 'Angel' as a nick name, as she has the tendency to call me that, was wondering if it was permissable?   Jazak'Allah"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Khadija, please contact me for this issue."
Isam Rajab,"You should tell her that she can't pray while her Awrah is uncovered. All scholars agreed that her prayer is incorrect, so you should advise her about that, you wait until she finishes because doing something to her while you're praying and she's praying may cause more problems, maybe she's a new Muslimah or maybe she doesn't know that her legs are exposed.   You're in a hurry! you don't have 2 minutes to advise your sister? But you have time to write this question?  I can't say whether you're sinful or not until I know why you were in a hurry. Your duty is to advise her and this is a must as the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said whoever so an evil he should change it. So unless you have a strong reason to leave this duty then you may be sinful."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   There are minor and major sins. The minor sins are forgiven through charities, good deeds and prayer for forgivness. The major sins require specific tawbah."
Isam Rajab,You should always be fearful and cautious if something good or bad happened. If something good happened then you thank Allah Subhanahu Wata'la but at the same time you don't grow arrogant and say it's because I'm good. Also if something bad happened you thank Allah subhanahu Wata'la and you blame yourself for it.   Once you did Istikhara then Allah Subhanahu Wata'la will choose for you but you can still do it again if you felt it's unlcear to you. Eventually Allah will choose for you.
Isam Rajab,Is it permissable to keep the name 'Emaan' for a female child?  Wasalaam u alaikum
Isam Rajab,Asalamu Aliakum Sheikh... i hope this reaches you in the best of health and Eman... i was at the Khalid Bin Al Walid's conference and i didn't get this question to be answered ...jazakum Allahu khair sheikh...  my Question is::  can a sister go on a birth control becuase she wants to finish her studies (2 years?                         .......... And .......... can a couple aviod pregnancy for two years until she finishes her studies or do they have to have sex when they get married?
Isam Rajab,"The only condition is not to seduce people with your voice!  I don't really know if you believe you were told, or you were really told! if you were told by a knowledgable person, then why you still seek another fatwa? Anyway, The Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam used to listen to &quot;Al-khansa&quot; Tamadur bint Amr, the famous female poet and nobody said that was wrong! Obviously she said &quot;non-dawa&quot; poetry!"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's better to pray all prayers at the beginning of the time, except for Isha because of the hadeeth. So it's better to pray Asr early, there's a hadeeth narrated by Jabir that the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam used to pray Asr and the sun is still &quot;active&quot; before it turns to the yellow color. In regards to the Maghrib, it's the same, yet it's not correct that you have to pray at the beginning or else it's over, although it's the new opinion of Imam Ashafie Rahimahullah. The prophet sallallahulaiahi wasallam once recited Surat Al A'raf in Maghrib prayer, Surat Al A'raf takes aprox. 1 hour to recite in prayer."
Isam Rajab,can witr be read 1 rak'at?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's permissible to accompany the son in law since he's forbidden forever on her and he's mahram so the conditions are satisfied. I know not any evidence stipulates that they have to take the daughter also."
Isam Rajab,"In a previous thread you stated that a woman shouldn't leave her husbands house when he pronounces talaq on her while she's pregnant. If the husband in this story hadn't provided her with a place becasue he hadn't found a good job yet and didn't have the money and STILL doesn't have the money to provide a place so is asking him to pay the woman back since it still is his resonsability and if they both agree not to live with each other casue they would fight all the time, and we know how thats not healthy for the pregnancy. Is this permissable? Is this situation permissable? Thanks,   Asalaam Alaikum"
Isam Rajab,Asalamu alaykum  What is the penalty for apostacy? and what things must be met before the penalty is passed on?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   I can't help you increasing your &quot;Wiswas&quot;. I've seen thousands or more of women praying without a single hair shown. When you cover your hair then it's covered no matter how much you move your head. You don't have to cover all your forehead, if you need to cover little of it that's fine. So give yourself a break."
Isam Rajab,"Assalaam-O-Alaikum,  Two nights ago my husband and I got into an argument and he stated that when my period was over that he wanted me out of the house and that that would be the third and final divorce.  When he didn抰 get the reaction that he thought he was going to get, he then says that he will never divorce me (so I can be miserable forever).  So my question is, is he allowed to take his first statement back?  The only reason the answer matters to me is because I need to know if I have to leave immediately or if I still have time after my menses is over.  My husband said that since the condition (my menses being over) hadn抰 been met yet, that it was okay for him to change his mind.  What's your take on this?"
Isam Rajab,Aslam U Alikum I have a question regarding prayer. I was praying my fagr salah and when i came up from rukoo i said &quot;bismillah&quot; by mistake and then i said samilullah hameda and all other adkhar of the salah. I wasn't sure that if i have to do sijdah sahwah because i added &quot;bismillah&quot; where i shouldn't be. So i didn't do any sijjdah sahwah at that time. But i m wondering is it correct what i did or do i have to repeat my prayer??  Jazakallah kher
Isam Rajab,"As salaam 'alaykum wa rahmatu Allah shaykh,  1. It is permissible in Islam to throw or have baby showers?  Jazakum Allahu Khairan"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Engagement is a promise of marriage. Whatever is forbidden before engagement remains forbidden after engagment. This applies to both talking on the phone and meeting in public, if there's a need for that then it's permissible. Talking on the phone is a sort of seclusion but it's not exactly a seclusion so a third party is not required as long as the proper manners are observed and thus if talking on the phone or meeting in public was with the knowledge of both families and in an appropriate manner then it's permissible. I believe I was asked the same questions previousely and I did answer it."
Isam Rajab,What is the distribution of meat in sacrifice of the animal at eid al adha
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, This ayah is in Surat Yunus 10:57."
Isam Rajab,"Assalaam Alaikum dear Shaykh,  I had a question concerning weddings... Well, i once heard an opinion from a shaykh that said that if it will make your parents happy if you celebrate their birthday, you should do it. or if your parents want you to take them to church you should take them, and something to this effect.  I was wondering if this is true first of all.. and if so, does the same thing apply to weddings? if my parents would be much happier if we had music and dancing at my wedding, should i consider that?  Jazakum Allahu Khairan for your efforts!"
Isam Rajab,This doesn't break the fast.
Isam Rajab,Assalamu alaykum  How can a person check they have not had black majic done to them?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   No, a kafir can't be a martyr.    The Prophet Sallallahualihai wasallam said: &quot;Al Mabtoon is a martyr&quot; &quot;Mabtoon&quot; means the one who has abdominal disease or sickness, so it includes the cancer in the colon."
Isam Rajab,"salam alaykum  Imaam Im not good at giving dawah in general, what do you suggest I can do?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   NO you don't wipe your ears twice unless you have strong feeling that you didn't wipe them at all. You can't wipe them just to make sure!"
Isam Rajab,"We're supposed to give dawa to non muslims especially if we know that they're not aware of anything about Islam, after informing them and after explaining to them about Islam then we have the choice whether we keep on doing this or we stop if we know for sure that they won't change.    It's always good to remind them from time to time and take every chance to call them to Dawa yet by gathering all the Ayat and Hadeeths about this issue we notice that it doesn't become mandatory after we already gave them enough information about Islam.   It's good to use different ways in Dawa but we can't use forbidden ways to reach a noble goal. So if she's a sister then she has to care about the places where she goes and the times that she spends.    If you feel that you're time might be better invested in something else other than talking to them then you can do that. Not everyone is good in Dawa, some are good in education other are good in finance and others are good in Dawa."
Isam Rajab,Assalamu alaykum warahmatullah  I am concerned that I am suffering from the effects of evil eye. How can one get rid of hassad and safeguard themselves from hassad in the future?
Isam Rajab,"as-salamu alaykum ya shaikh,   in the masjid near work mashallah many muslims come for al-Jumuah, all four floors get packed out. The masjid does a second jamah with a second imam every friday.   I assume it is permissible to regularly ie every week have this arrangement rather than just once in a while? Because -- you cant fit everyone in to one Jamah only.   Then my question to you is:  Is it better to strive to attend the first jamah? Is this 'better' in any way?  Is the second jamah 'less valid', would i get less ajr from my salah in the second jamah?  barakallah feekum!"
Isam Rajab,"If you're father is pleased with this then this is sufficient but if he's not then you have to do more. Usually joining the kinship can't be done by letters only especially to your father, you have to visit him and see him or at least you should call him from time to time, but if he's pleased with letters then it's his right and he gave it up so it should be ok.    Remeber that the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam said: &quot;the one who joins the kinship is not the one who treats others like they treat him, the one who joins the kinship is the one who when his family discontinue to join him he joins them&quot;. So you should not wait for your father to tell you what to do. You have to do this regardless of the reaction of him or any family member."
Isam Rajab,"Normally i give the interest i recieve from my bank to charity. I know I will not be rewarded for that. Recently I used the money to get a non-muslim a gift. I dont think I will do it again, but was that ok? I didnt use that money on a muslim or to benefit myself."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Do you mind writing in a better way please instead of apologizing?   It's forbidden to call on any dead, so you're forbidden from calling the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam. Allah commanded us to call on Him alone.   &quot;Tassawul&quot; means Begging. I think you mean &quot;Tawassul&quot;, the hadeeth of the blind man was during the lifetime of the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam, otherwise, every blind man asks with this dua will became able to see, and that's not the case.   No single companion asked the Messenger Sallallahulaihai wasallam after his death. Even Omar Radiallahu anh didn't ask the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam but he asked from the Unlce of the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam &quot;Al-Abbas&quot;, which tells you clearly that you can't ask the dead."
Isam Rajab,"Having a muslim name doesn't make you muslim! When we say La ilaha illallah, this statement has conditions we should fulfill."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   The one who disobeys Allah Subhanahu Wata'la especially with major sins is anything but cool! He/she may be poor, idiot or fool but not cool. I advise you to stay away from her except to advise her. You should fear Allah Subhanahu Wata'la more than you fear your cousin, so if she said or did something wrong remind her even if she'll be upset because that's better than disobeying Allah Subhanahu Wata'la. If you stole something or took things unlawfully then you should return them and ask for Allah's forgiveness and He'll forgive you inshallah. If this happened long time ago and you can't give people back their things then you pray for them and if you know them you better ask them to forgive you. Pray for your cousin that may Allah Subhanahu Wat'la guide her to the correct path and maybe if you seek the help of older wise people they'll help you inshallah talking to her and reminding her and she'll be guided inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamualiakum,  Omar ibn Abdulaziz rahimahullah is one of the greatest muslim leaders and scholars as well. all the historians and shcolars who documented his life mentioned so. Imam athahabi documented some of his sayings about Iman and following the sunnah in his book:&quot;siar A'lam Annubala&quot;  biographies of the noble people. 5/125."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, It depends on the nature of the bank, if it deals with interst then No it's not permissible. If you're directly helping paying or getting interest or even witnessing interest then it's forbidden. If your job is in the bank but has nothing to do with forbidden financial transaction then there are two opinions and the stronger one is that it's permissible but it's still not recommended."
Isam Rajab,What are you to do if the Imam says Allahu Akbar for Rukuu but you aren't done with the surah/ayah? Just stop where you are or complete the ayah and what if the ayah is long?
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu alaikum sheikh, I am a married convert sister, alhamdulillah. I have a problem that is really bothering my iman a lot. I have a very bad opinion of men in general. I have never had a close relationship with my father and have very few personal good experiences with mahram men. I tend to see whatever men do in a bad light (i.e. I make bad assumptions) but then I find that I am often RIGHT that they are as I think.  I do not act badly towards men usually because I do not know many men very well (since I do not have a lot of muslim mahrams) and I do not necessarily see anything very bad in them. However, it seems like everytime I open an advice column(muslim or nonmuslim) or newspaper or I go out in public or do anything, I hear/see about how bad men are (very lustful, abusing their wives, molesting children, raping women, abandoning their responsibilities or families, being ungrateful to their parents, exploiting weak people, acting superior because they have accomplished things that women are able to but are prevented because of family responsibilities or obedience, being strict with their females yet being lax about themselves).   I know that a practicing muslim guy should not do these things, but most people on earth are not muslim and if they are muslim they may not be practicing. even though I may read good stories of good men (ie prophets) or I know a some good men (my husband, brother, etc), it doesn't change my opinion.  My husband and I have gotten into many arguments because he thinks that men are more abused in the world and I think the opposite (even if I don't say anything, I get so furious if I have to hear anything about this).   I have to stop automatically thinking the worst because it makes me think bad things of people who may not be bad. or it makes me think bad things about people that i am supposed to have good thoughts about. How can I change myself?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If this Imam is doing his job yet he's not paid enough then your people don't deserve him and it's unfortunate that he's still there. What kind of people have their leader yet he's in need? If this Imam is able to work extra time and stop asking people then he should not be an Imam for one more day as he was supposed to be an example for his community. I'm sorry but I don't see any third option, whether you are no good people at all or he's not a good Imam."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam alaikum  If you're currently out of job and you owe money to the state and your debts are constantly growing because you can抰 afford to pay back the money you owe,can you have a family member who earns money from selling har鈓 meat, pig and alcohol help you pay they debt?  May Allaah reward you for your help"
Isam Rajab,I'm sorry but I don't know the answer.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   There's no problem in calling a program: Qiyamullail if your intention is to remind people of the virtues of qiyamullail. Actually that's an excellent topic to discuss. But this is different that doing it in congregation. To call people for qiyamullail. It's better to avoid doing this as it was not done by the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes he can call. The consent of the wali is required but not his attendance."
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh,  I hope you're reading this in good health and strong iman.  I'm aware that females are not to travel without a mahram for ones safety lakin what about a situation where there is no mahram. For example with me my brothers are married and don't live any where near me. My father....May Allah (swt) rest his soul in peace. Any uncles i have, are not known to me because the only time i have seen them was when i was young. As for nephews, well i have a nephew who is 10ish and again i don't live near him.    In a case where it is not possible to take a mahram with you what is one to do? Is it sinful or it disliked to travel alone?  Barakallahu feek for your time and effort."
Isam Rajab,"as salaam alaikum,  There are brothers in my community who think that beating and mistreating their wives is perfectly normal. What is the islamic ruling on hitting your wife for no reason whatsoever. Also if the wife does get beaten on a day to day basis, can she divorce her husband even though she remains patient but the mistreating gets worse and worse by the day?  jazakAllah khair  wasalaam"
Isam Rajab,Yes it is.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   There are scholars who said the hair on the cheek is from the beard and others who said it's not. So I believe your husband should be worried about that not you. You can only advise him but not going through debates with him.   The other part of the face you mentioned is called &quot;Anfaqa&quot; and it's attached to the beard so it has the same ruling of the beard."
Isam Rajab,It depends on the topic they're discussing. You're allowed not only to attend shia'h lectures. but you're allowed to attend kuffar lectures when you know it's beneficial! So it depends on the subject discussed. Unless it's about something that contradicts the belief of Ahlussunah wal Jama'h; you're allowed to attend it. Even if it's about a clear falsehood and you know that you can clarify the belief of Ahlussunah you can still go.
Isam Rajab,"Asalaam uh alaikum wa Rahmatullah  My question is that how long ago was our Father Adam (as) around? The Christians and also ibn Abbas in Tabari's Tareekh I think says 6,000 years ago - but if that is true doesn't this contradict science and its so-called claim of finding human remains/fossils aged at over millions of years ago.   Jazak'Allah Khairan. Wasalaam"
Isam Rajab,Salaam alaikoem  Is it halal to use perfum. the ingredients say it contains alcohol.   barakallaho feek.
Isam Rajab,"You can't go to the Quran and Sunnah and derive rulings by yourself unless you're a scholar or advanced student of knowledge. Allah says in the Quran {So ask the people of knowledge if you don't know (al-anbiya 21:7 and al-nahl 16:43)} he didn't say go and derive the rulings by yourself.   You don't have to follow one mathhab but you have to follow someone who has knowledge.    Many people think that they can open the Quran or read the Hadeeth and find the verdict, but they never do that when it comes to medicine or any other worldly thing. They always go to the people of knowledge."
Isam Rajab,"i have been hearing that girls are not allowed to go to cemetaries...i just didnt understand why? no one gave me a valid reason and when i was searching for the reasons, i couldnt find any in any hadiths or any verse. thank you  assalamalykum"
Isam Rajab,"assalamu alaykum  If I am on the road travelling for a few hours, and the time for Maghrib and 'Isha come, but I delay them until I reach my home, and then join them once I reach home, is this permissable?  (Of course, within the proper time for 'Isha.)  jazakallahu khayr"
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu alaykum  If a man has 2 wives, in akhirah which wife will he be with? and also if a woman married a man, and then after his death married another man, who would she be with in akhirah?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   I don't like to be asked a question after asking other people!  Anyway, the correct opinion is that it's considered 1 talqa. So she's divorced but since this happened for a short time only then she can automatically come back to her husband without doing anything unless she's divorced twice before then she can't marry him and she has to wait for her iddah if she wanted to marry another person.   So again the correct opinion is that it's considered divorce and she has to count the iddah but because it happened in a short time then she can go back to her husband without new contract or mahr."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, I didn't understand your question! Do you want the translation in Arabic? If that's the case then you can say: اللهم ارزقني زوجاً صالحاً"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   The beating that Allah mentioned in the Quran is not like what people think the beating of teenagers or the boxers or so, it's just a reminder and it's true that it's not real beating. It was mentioned that he hit her with the tooth-stick.   I'd like you to correct the aya you quoted: &quot;Wa inna ....&quot; because it's &quot;Fa inna ...&quot;"
Isam Rajab,Yes we may be the descendents of Nuh Alaihissalam or we maybe still the descendents of Adam Alaihissalam since the people who were with Nuh are not all of them from his family.
Isam Rajab,Using bad words don't nullify Wudu. If you smile in the prayer then your prayer still valid unless you laugh then you need to repeat the prayer.   you need to remember when you pray that you're standing before Allah.
Isam Rajab,"We do many good deeds that we don't know exactly the reward for them, yet we'll be rewarded anyway!  I don't remember any scholar said that you have to know exactly the reward for your deed before you do it otherwise you wont be rewarded!   You only have to be sincere in your action and your intention is to please Allah but the reward itself might vary. If you recite one letter of the Quran you may get 10 hasanat or you may get 7000 or even more.   Sometimes you get more than one type of the reward such as reciting SuratulMulk, if you recite it every night before you sleep you'll be protected from the punishment in the grave but that doesn't mean you wont be rewarded the Ajr &quot;the reward&quot; of the recitation."
Isam Rajab,"I heard this story long time ago, i don't really recall it's authenticity, yet you can inshallah share it with others since it's not about fiqh or faith issue, scholars tolerate this type of stories as long as it's not really fabricated or very weak."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If salat is made before time then it's invalid and it has to be repeated."
Isam Rajab,"My children have been asking me some interesting questions which I really do not know the answer.  Please help  me.  First if one is doing wudhu and they forget how many times they did something whether it was 2 or 3 what should one do?  Also if you feel that a small part for instance of your arm did not get wet, should you do the wudhu all over or can you just wash that part?  Also if I feel my shawl or the scarf on my head is slipping can I fix it during prayer or will that invalidate prayer. And I would have to start over?"
Isam Rajab,"I don't think it's confusing. You can still seek blessings from the traces of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam after his death and it was done by the companions, what I meant was asking him Sallallahualaihi wasallam himself. The blackstone is a different thing, whatever is sunnah then it's sunnah regardless of the life or death of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam. Visiting those historical places is allowed to know the history not as part of our religion, there's no special blessings in those places. Same thing applies to the walls or the grave of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam. Actually, the prophet sallallahualaihi wasallam cursed those who take his grave as a place of worship. We follow the sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam and the way of his companions may Allah be pleased with them and no one came to his grave to touch it or seek blessings from it."
Isam Rajab,No you can't wear them. The pig is impure and all parts of it are not halal to use or eat. That's the correct opinion.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh, Not listening to the Quran in your car is not a sin. It becomes a sin when you have an evidence that you have to listen to it and you're not doing it then it becomes a sin. You can't force your friend to be silent all the trip so you may start with few minutes and then you talk, it's recommended to listen to the Quran if you're driving but you don't have to, so if you turn on the Quran and you talk it's not recommended but it's not also haram. It's haram during the prayer. That's what scholars said but outside the prayer they differed."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If they're not living together how she get pregnant? temporary meeting? Anyway, if that's the case and they got divorced then she's still in Idda until she delivers the baby. So she's still married and if she's still married then all the rights of marriage for the husband should be fulfilled."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum wr wb,  Shaikh how do you remember all those Hadeeth? And what happened during the life of all the prophets and all that ???  Its my biggest dream to become an Islamic Scholar. But my problem is that I can't remember anything. During classes I try my best to write down every single thing you say. And I even understand what you saying and all that. But as soon as class gets over and I close my notebook I forget everything. Well not everything but most of the things. Like the names of the prophets or names of those who narrated hadeeth and what they said in the hadeeth.   I really need help. I don't know how to keep my memorization strong.    Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said: &quot; The Imam is only assigned to be followed so when he does Takbir you do Takbir and when he bows you bow ...&quot;   So when the Imam does the Salam then you should also finish your prayer and do the Salam. It's not recommended to stay after the Imam finished. You have to accustom yourself to follow the Imam.
Isam Rajab,"Rafa' indeed means raise. Be it a rank of a physical raise. It depends on the context and the object. In principle, all meanings should be taken literally unless there's an evidence. So in principle it's a physical raise and that's the case of Issa (Jesus) peace be upon him he was raised physically. Allah says in another place: {Allah raises those who believe and those who have knowledge ranks} so the word ranks is used otherwise it would have been thought a physical raise."
Isam Rajab,"as salaamu 'alaykum wa ruhmatuallaahi wa barakatuhu  What is the ruling on praying against another arrogant foolish Muslim who has wronged me verbally?  Rather, what is the ruling in general praying against someone whether Muslim or kaafir?  Jazaakullaah khayr  as salaamu 'alaykum wa ruhmatuallaahi wa barakatuhu"
Isam Rajab,"Yes because if you tell him he may be displeased with Allah Subhanahu Wata'la and you'll be the reason for that and it may break his heart as well. And the true Muslim is the one who loves for his brother what he loves for himself. When you tell others about the blessings that Allah bestowed upon you, the objective should be to encourage them not to show off. So you have to be wise when to whom you say that and when."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   &quot;It's even worse&quot; is not a hadeeth, it's the opinion of a companion so remember that because there are other narrations from other companions who used to eat standing.   Scholars said that most of the Ahadeeth allowing drinking while standing pertain to Zamzam water and it could be allowed to the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam only.   So in conclusion you may eat standing while it's better to sit and it's very disliked to drink standing unless it's Zamzam water."
Isam Rajab,"It depends on the intention why the Quran was recited regardless of who's listening to it. If the Quran wasn't recited, is there a better alternative? We should teach people that once the Quran is recited they should listen and respect the word of Allah. Being covered or uncovered is irrelevant in this matter."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes Bilal Radiallahu Anh was a slave and he was freed by Abu Bakr Radiallahu Anh."
Isam Rajab,asalamu3laikoom can you give me a hadith where it says for a man to go to the masjid?
Isam Rajab,Assuming that the Shaykh resides in the United States and is aware of health care in this country. The mandatory insurance has helped to increase medical costs to the point that too many people cannot afford health care without it.   Under what circumstances would health insurance be persmissible?
Isam Rajab,"I am a convert and I recently got married (Allhemdullah). My husband  is finishing school out of town and just came back for a few weeks  to spend together. We are really suffering because he has jinn.   Someone did black magic to him a long time ago.  It is affecting all  the areas of our marriage and is so hurtful and we fight. I did not  think it was going to be this bad when I married him.  I do not know  what to do.  I watch him suffer and struggle against this evil  constantly and now he is saying he is tired of fighting it, he is  really depressed and does not have any zest for life.  I think this  hurts more to see him go through this.  Unfortunately, there does  not seem to be alot of knowledge on the science of extracting the  jinn here in Canada and he has tried numerous Imams to no avail.   What I want to say is I am so scared.  I am not sure I can live with  his condition.  It is as though he has a sickness almost 2  personalities,one is kind the other not so nice, forgetful, thinks  he did things when he did not, does not want to be around me at  times (hard considering we are newly married and have not seen each  other for 4 months).I know he is a kind and genuine person inside I  just am not sure if I can live with his sickness and give up my  needs constantly to be with him.  There is a chance he may never be  fixed. Needless to say I am not sure I could have a child with him  with his condition.  I do not know what to do.  I am not a selfish  person it is just I am not sure I can go on continually denying ones  needs. I am getting pretty sad.  Please give me any advice you can.   May Allah reward you."
Isam Rajab,No you don't. This is only in the prayer.
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu alaykum  In surat Muhammad ayah 15 it talks about rivers in paradise and someone said they have names, i wanted to know if this is correct and if so what are the names?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   you need to know first why they refuse to let you do so?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam warahmatullahi wabarakatuh,   Music is not everywhere unless you want it to be so. You're not forced to watch TV to begin with. So I disagree with you that music is played everywhere. It's true there are many places where music is played but be read and keep Quranic cds or MP3 players with you and take advantage of your time when you're shopping or outside the house.   Regarding your question, Allah will not hold you accountalbe for something you can't control. You have to avoid listening to music yet if it happened without you willing so then try to busy yourself with something else. usually you won't start singing until you spend good deal of time listening to it.    Rember that singing is different than music, singing could be allowed according to some scholars while music is not so."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   If your wife's friend breastfed your son 5 full sessions then yes she becomes his foster mother and her daughters are his foster sisters so can't marry any of them and you should make sure this doesn't happen. If it's only once then she's still stranger and he can marry from her daughters."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I don't know any evidence differs between a Muslim woman and a non muslim woman in regards to Awrah so it should be the same."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   You can have everything your heart desires in Jannah as long as it's fine. You can't wish to marry your mother in paradise and you can't wish to have a male wife if you're male! so the same thing for women they'll wish for one husband only.    I advise you to wait until you enter paradise inshallah and then you think of this thing."
Isam Rajab,"Wa-laaikumussalam,   The obligatory prayers can't be done sitting, it has to be done standing unless there's an excuse such as a person who can't stand up or if you're traveling in the plane and there's no room to stand and if you wait you'll miss the prayer on time, in this case you can pray sitting, however, this doesn't apply to the car for you can stop it anytime and pray standing.   The optional prayer can be done sitting because Anas once came riding while he was praying and he said that the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam did it."
Isam Rajab,"In this case I suggest that you ask another Muslim butcher and if he gave you the same answer as the first one then it should be sufficient, otherwise you go ahead and avoid it."
Isam Rajab,No he wasn't. If an army was sent then Khalid was supposed to be sent instead of Muath.
Isam Rajab,what it takes to make your child prepare them from early childhood years to become - where you are at this stage and position?  what is the reward from Allah for you of all that you are doing - in this world and herefater? anything specifically mentioned?
Isam Rajab,"asalaalmo alaiykum,  when we go to any shoe shop in our country, theres only men in those shops, i have never seen any ladies in such sections. hence when they give us the shoe to try it on, our feet is naturally uncovered to them, when checking for our size or trying out any slippers. is this permissable if not what should we do then when buying shoes from male salesperson?"
Isam Rajab,There is a rule in Sharia called: The necessity is measured by the need. Which means if you need to uncover the Awrah in fornt of one doctor then you can't uncover it in front of 2 doctors for no need! You can't say as long as it's uncovered then whether it's one or 10 it's the same. You can't do that according to this fundemantal rule.    So based on that the mahram should be present instead of a non mahram because he cares more about his relative and he's not supposed to look so he'll consider that as well. It's impermissible to expose the awrah to both of them because there's no need for that.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Yes it is."
Isam Rajab,"It depends on the case. You may call your brother or someone who's absent but it's still not shirk. I think you mean calling upon the dead. If that's what you meant then it also depends, if you call upon them to bring good or prevent evil then yes this is shirk."
Isam Rajab,"Kissing a guy doesn't make you gay! Shaving the beard doesn't make you  gay as well! Unless he admits that by himself, or 4 people saw him with their eyes doing the act itself; you can't accuse him of such a horrible thing. Assuming you know a muslim who's gay! you have to be careful dealing with him, if you feel that he might fear Allah if he was reminded, then you can do advise him, otherwise, you desert him totally, since this is not a regular sin, it's against nature."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's sunnah to recite Surat Al Mulik every night as it'll protect for you but I don't know about Surat Assajdah."
Isam Rajab,Asslamualakum  Ya Shayk  What is the best manner to give dawah to a Shi'ate? What main issues could i convince him on?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Unfortunately, I don't interpret dreams. I'm sorry."
Isam Rajab,i told a lie and a lot of people found out about it. not that i lied but about the subject of the lie.  i wasnt thinking that this lie was going to become such a big deal. i am truly sorry and i wish to repent. how should i do this?
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu 3Alaikum   A sister's husband sings to her almost every time he is in her presence. She hates this as   a) he does not sing nasheed but sings Western pop/rock songs that he heard before he was practising b) at the least this would be mubah - waste of speech/time - but possibly the ruling is worse (as it is enjoying something of the disbelievers, which is a sin in the first instance) c) the worst thing is that it is done in front of her children, who will then pick up the habit of singing all the time, and may pick up the tune/words d) it is done to excess, to the point that she has picked up the lyrics to songs she has never heard by being exposed to it e) it does not bring about any love but rather makes the sister feel very distant and adverse to her husband and infuriated f) it makes her iman feel low, especially as sometimes the songs may be those which she had listened to before she was practising and wants to distance herself from that sin g) her husband often imitates the sound of the instruments or taps out the rhythm  The brother justifies this by referring to fatwas where it says it is permissible to sing to your spouse etc. The sister feels it is incorrect in her case, as when such questions have been asked before there is no background to the question, as in her case, outlined above.  What is the ruling then on this particular brother singing?  You said in an answered question that some scholars say it is haram to sing - can you name them please?  jzk"
Isam Rajab,"Akhi I answered this question twice or more!   I disagree with people when they say we should take interest because otherwise they'll take it. When you open a checking account they won't take your money! you can withdraw it anytime you want, so there's no interest. What's the difference when you open a checking or saving account? they'll use your money either way.    So I say as long as you can open a checking account then it's forbidden to open a savings account."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes, some scholars allowed shaking hands with old women because there's no fitna involved there. Old is a relative thing but what's known for people as old then it's old.   Other scholars said it's still impermissible even for old women because people may take this as an excuse to shake hands always."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, Scholars have different opinions regarding this issue, some of them said if the person missed one prayer without a valid excuse then he's not a muslim. The majority said if he missed the prayer but he's still saying La Ilaha Illa Llah then he's still a muslim however he should be punished by the muslim ruler &quot;he has to be imprisoned until he prays or he'll be killed&quot;."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Some shaykhs did lots of research about the Health Insurance issue, in brief it's permissible in this country to have health insurance."
Isam Rajab,"Aslam U alikum I did  a istikaharah that whether should i go back home and get married or get married in the country i m living (i.e. western country), after few days of doing istikahara, I made decision that i will go back home and get married . However now situation is that its not feesible to go back home or it doesn't seem appropriate looking at the situation to go back home for atleast an year or year and a half. so my question is during this time if i find a girl which is religiously commited and of good character in the country where i m living , can i marry her in that situation? or that would i be going against the istikharah i did before hence doing something which Allah doesn't want from me  Jazakallah kher"
Isam Rajab,"This has been a debatable issue for long time, whether Muslims should participate in the political operation or not. I believe we still need to work hard on that issue, in America, Alhamdulillah, CAIR is doing great job. I really don't know about the UK &quot;although my brother is a British citizen and I visited him 4 years ago&quot;, yet, whenever you could limit the evil or let others hear your voice and consider you, then you should do it. So if you know that there's a candidate who would be better for Muslims and the world, then I believe you should vote."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, Yes your prayer will be valid. As long as the Imam doesn't commit an act of Kufr then your prayer is valid, and as long as he doesn't commit a bida'h which leads to kufr then you pray behind him unless there's a better person near where you could pray behind him. This is a mistake but it's not kufr."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If you ask someone of knowledge then you need to remember that his job is not to satisfy you but to satisfy Allah Subhanahu Wata'la. Otherwise, you shouldn't have asked him at the first place. There are of course some cases where you are allowed to ask again if your intention was not to find the most appealing answer to you."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Can't you take 5 mintues break for prayer?  I'm sorry but this is not an acceptable excuse. You're not traveling or sick. There are very limited excuses and this doesn't meet the emergency situation."
Isam Rajab,"Salamu alaykum,   My parents pray Alhumdulilah. But my extended family doesn't. My aunts and uncles don't think its important and I think that my young cousins are begining to feel the same. A few of them used to pray but now they have left it. How can I give them dawah without them retaliating ? Also, if one of them were to die...I couldn't pray Janaza prayers for them ? Is it true that if you leave prayers then you are out of the fold of islam ?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   There are lots of institutions in North America or overseas. You should first excel in your school and get high grades and then think of the Islamic studies. You have lots of places in Toronto and I believe Sh. Muhammad Al Shareef is coming soon to give his class there.   You should not look at people and try to do what they're doing. Allah Subhanahu Wata'la created us differently. Maybe Allah blessed me with something you don't have and maybe Allah gave you something I don't have so if you try to ignore what Allah Subhanahu Wata'la has given you and try to do like others then you may not succeed. There are lots of ways to help Islam and come close to Allah Subhanahu Wata'la. Ask yourself first what do you want and be sincere in your intention.   Interest is haram be it here or anywhere else. Only when it comes to interest people start saying it's ok! why don't we say drinking alcohol is also permissible? committing adultry is permissible? skipping some prayers is also permissible!"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I don't recall a hadeeth with that meaning. However, this is something everyone agrees on. It's mention in the Quran by Shuaib Peace be upon him when he told his people that he doesn't want to say something to them and then does the opposite.   If you wanted people to respond to you, you should start with yourself. However, if you're giving a piece of advice to someone, he shouldn't tell you this as long as your advice is valid. It's true that we should perfect ourselves, but it's not true that we can't advise unless we're perfect, all of us have shortcomings and we all make mistakes."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu aleikum  1. Is it permissible for a (married) man to have conversations with his female cousin (unmarried, non-practising, non-mahram)? They are both young (early/mid-20's) [I have mentioned these details in the event it has any bearing on the case]  2. Can you elaborate on the precise limits of what is permissible e.g. salaam, how are you etc, or whether to have a proper conversation, whether its a one off call after a long period of time, to do so regularly/frequently?  3. Would it be correct for them to speak over the phone (without other relatives or spouses present for example) or to exchange emails regularly?  4. If the sister wanted to know more about Islam would it not be better to put her in contact with the brother's wife, rather than the brother engages in long term da'wah with her?  jazakAllah kheiran"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, No it's not obligatory on the woman to offer a sacrifice. And according to the majority of shcolars it's not even an obligatory on the man even if he was rich. It's merely an established sunnah. Once the sacrifice is offered. It's sufficient for the entire household. This hadith you mentioned is narrated by Imam Ahmad and Ibn Majah and it's an evidence for the minority who say it's mandatory, but some said it has weakness so it's not authentic. The correct opinion after investigation is that this hadith is mawquf on Abu Hurairah so it's him who said it. It's not elevated to the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam."
Isam Rajab,Esalam Eleikum Can a brother and his sister sleep in the same room after reaching puberty but on seperate beds? Or must each one have their own room?
Isam Rajab,What is the most appropriate way and age in which to teach a child the story of Lut (as)? I have not been able to find many materials on this in Arabic or English for children.
Isam Rajab,"No it's not permissible, it's the same as smoking ciggarettes."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum,  Wishing someone his/her birthday is allowed ?   Yesterday was my brother-in-law's birthday and he made me to wish him. He said that when Prophet Mohammad Sallahu Alaihi Wasallam born everyone celebrated that day so its okay to wish someone. And I was telling him that its not okay. If it was okay to wish someone than Sahabas could wish Prophet Mohammad Sallahu Alaihi Wasallam every year on his birthday but they did not. We had a long argument. So, I just want to confirm that if its okay or not to wish someone his/her birthday?   Jazak ALLAH Khair  Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,You don't have to wear &quot;thobe&quot;.   there's no such &quot;Islamic clothings&quot; but there are few conditions in every dress you wear.   When the Prophet Sallallahualihai wasallam received the message and when his companions became muslims he didn't tell every single one of them to change his clothes to a &quot;muslim clothes&quot;. All what you have to do is to meet the conditions such as covering the Awra and avoiding the clothes that only the Kuffar wear.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   No it's not true. That means his mother was inside the Ka'bah which is not true at all."
Isam Rajab,Question: A person works for a company dealing in &quot;Satallite TV&quot; products/services. Is his money Jaiz. If it is not Jaiz can he dispose of the money as Sadaqah or to those in the path of Allaah. Or pay of his debts.   Shukran
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Burn these copies. Don't try to say something or preach something without verifying it. That's our job as Muslims. Try to educate yourself before you turn to others. If you're sure about what you're saying then it's ok even if it's only one Ayah."
Isam Rajab,I don't see this as a good solution becasue you don't avoid sinning (by not having a baby forever) through committing another sin (lying). You may tell him openly that you'll have a baby and he should expect that anytime.
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu alaikum wa rahmat Allahi wa barakaatuh  My friend emailed me this question and wanted me to pass it onto a sheikh who can answer, inshallaah you can help  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I am facing some difficulty right now and I don抰 know how to go about it. I have some issues with my mother ever since I started wearing niqaab and dropped out of school. My mother is determined to go visit her family abroad, but since we don抰 have any mahaarim to accompany us this, isn抰 an option and I have explained this to her. However she has made up her mind and is going to travel despite having explained to her the ruling on travelling without a mahram.   Some sheikh tried to pass a fatwa about it being okay, since the aim of the travel was to visit her parents before they died, but I told her we have to abide by the ahkaam and she can call her parents and talk to them and keep in contact with them this way instead of travelling without a mahram.   The problem however is that she wants me to go with her as well- in fact she insists I go with herI have told her I won抰 go with her, but she is giving me a very hard time about it and won抰 allow me to stay at home if she travels. I told her if she won抰 allow me to stay at home while she travels, I抎 stay with my father and his wife. She won抰 accept this either, so I抦 now stuck and don抰 know what to do.  This is causing severe fitnah and is damaging our relationship- at times I can抰 even concentrate on my prayers, because she sometimes raises her voice at me while I抦 in my room praying. This is very distressing subhan Allaah.  What is you advice regarding my situation ya sheikh?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   As long as your forced to go then you won't be accounted for that. But are you really forced or not?   Maybe by going there you could do a great Dawa to them, ask them why they worship Jesus? Try to explain to them the greatness of Islam.   Make sure that your heart is not happy with what they're doing because if you go often they you may feel that it's ok and it's nice to share their disbelief."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   I'm not sure if this is a black magic or not. Some people the moment they see something wrapped they think automatically that it's magic. Anyways, what you did is correct. Burning is one of the best methods to rid the amulets if there were no knots. If there were knots then you should've recited surat Al Falaq and Surat Annas every time you untie a knot as the Messenger Sallallahualaihi Wasallam did.  There's no reason for you to keep the images of these papers so you should delete them."
Isam Rajab,"as-salamu alaykum,  there is a question answered by the shaykh on joining where he spoke of general permissibility with conditions (&quot;It's allowed to join the army of a non muslim country with conditions, the most important one of them is not to fight muslims.(...)&quot;)..  ..may I ask for more detail please for my own clarity, as was told muslims could not serve under the military command of a non-muslim?  ..also the Oath of Allegience (for example here in the UK, it is to the Queen (and her heirs if i recall correctly)).. and saluting/standing up/honouring her, their flag and senior staff etc..?"
Isam Rajab,I heard Mc Donalds and B.K. are haram because of the oil they use. KFC they do something to their chicken some kinds of chemicals to make it puffy(more meat). What do you say shaykh?
Isam Rajab,"As salamu alikum  Sometime ago (approximately 10 years) i was involved in a car crash.I was awarded some money as compensation, however, i have not been allowed to access this money until now. The money itself is not a particularly large amount, however over the years, it has accumulated some interest.  Is the interest on this money haram?  If so, can i donate it to a member of my family? The family being from my father's side, who currently reside in N.Africa (A cousin to be more specifc).In this case, the money would not in any way shape or form be used on or by myself (I currently reside in the Uk, my place of birth).  Jazakallahukhair for your time and help,  Wa alikum salam"
Isam Rajab,One of my friends wants to convert to Islam or he has been interested in Islam for a while. But he doesn't know how to start. I have told him to seek help at his local masjid. He has asked me several questions about Islam and some I have been unable to answer because I am learning myself. I don't think I clarify things for him as much as he needs to hear. I think I end up confusing him more or I can not explain things as well as I should. What should I do...besides learning more about my religion myself? How can I call him to Islam and make him believe and see the truth in Islam?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   Do you mean the metal tags? Like the marines use? If that's what you're talking about then it depends on the intention of having them, it could be imitating the kuffar and it could not."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If you fast voluntary then you should not break your fast without a reason. But if you're ivited then you can break your fast and you don't have to make up that day because it's not mandatory. This is the opinion of the majority of scholars which is the strong opinion.   Imam Abu Hanifa Rahimahullah says you have to make up your fast even if it's essentialy optional because you made it obligatory upon yourself."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikaum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   The sunna is not to recite aloud in Thuhr and Asr so you should not do it, but if you did it then your prayer is still correct. I don't advise you to do so, that's not the solution for your khushu"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's very hard to learn without a teacher or mentor. No single scholar throughout Islam became a scholar by himself.  But as a starter you could read &quot;When the Moon split&quot; in Sirah to learn more about the Messenger Sallallahualaihi Wasallam.  In sciences of the Quran, there are few books with the same title an introduction to the sciences of the quran, I recommend the one by Yasir Qadhi. There's another book in Tawhid: A critical study of shirk by Yasir Qadhi also.  I'm away from my library so I can't give you other books. There's a translated text in Fiqh of imam Ashafie, very simple and brief but I don't have its ISDN handy.   You actually showed me that we need to have something like that available for everyone. I actually do this for my students at Arees but inshallah I'll add a page for everyone who wants to seek knoweledge and what should they do and what are the books to read. This will come soon inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The father can perform the marriage on behalf of his daughter even if she's not available. It's always better to have the daughter available but it's not a condition.    In some mathhabs this is true even if the daughter is not pleased with this marriage. This happened at the time of the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam, a daughter came to him and complained so the messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam gave her the option to accept or reject the marriage, however she was pleased with it. If this had not been permissible the prophet sallallahualaihi wasallam would not have given her the option, he would have just told her don't worry about it as the marriage wasn't right to begin with."
Isam Rajab,"You should've done that for the sake of Allah Subhanahu wata'la, you can do it now. Just purify your intention and Allah will accept from you inshallah. Many times, people don't do things for the sake of Allah, but later on, their intentions become correct."
Isam Rajab,"No, men are allowed to listen to duff since they're already allowed to paly it! the verb &quot;play with it&quot; came in arabic with the masculine form.  Do other similar instruments take the same rulings? there are two opinions."
Isam Rajab,If he divorces her for no reason then that's why we have Islamic court in this life and supreme court in the hereafter where he'll find the reward or punishment for his deeds.   If he was so bad to the extent that he threw her in the street then I really believe there's a problem with the sister herself becasue she accepted such a man. There's no system on earth gave justice for both spouses more than Islam whether people knew it or not.
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum,  I heard that when you put nail polish your wudu will not be valid because the water will not touch your nails it will touch the nail polish. And is it the same with fake nails.   Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   One way is to think of the good things this person has. Then to think of the shortcoming you have. Then you can pray to Allah Subhanahu Wata'la to remove this feeling from your heart."
Isam Rajab,"asalamualiaykum,  can we kil , bee's ,mosquito's and similar relatives with a poisionous spray killer that is available in the market? or leave them alone? which one Allah prefers and asks us to do with them?"
Isam Rajab,"The worship has to include submission, love and humility to Allah Subhanahu Wata'la. If it misses one of these three elements then it's incomplete. Obedience could be a result of Ibadah when you worship Allah you become more obedient. Also obedience is the core of Ibadah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   If you eat from this chocolate that doesn't mean you're headless. Usually every product has nutrition information on the cover so you could check on that. If you don't know anything wrong then you could eat.   Of course you're making thigs way difficult for yourself, May Allah help you."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   What do you want me to explain?  The knowledge of Allah Subhanahu Wata'la is everywhere. There are angels with human beigns 24/7 writing their deeds and don't leave them at all. But the angels are different, there are angels of forgiveness and mercy and they don't enter these places."
Isam Rajab,Strongest opinions are two: The time when the Imam climbs the Minber before he delivers the Khutba. Or the last hour before Maghrib. I strongly believe it's the second opinion.
Isam Rajab,"Asalaam u alaykum  I have been reading a lot about the different points of views on different issues according to the scholars Hanafi, Shafi, Hanbali, Maliki. My question is that like in an issue like a woman leading other women in prayer.  People of one madhab follow what their scholar had said.  and the other follow theirs.  Each have their reasons.  Hanafi have their hadiths, Shafi have their hadith to back up waht they say.  How do WE figure out who is right.  Each points to verses in Quran or Hadiths or Sunnah.   How can we make an accurate decision as to which Hadith is right or which is wrong? Which madhab is right?"
Isam Rajab,"No it's not ok to talk to each other every day even if they claim to like each other, if they really like each other they would obey Allah Subhanahu Wata'la and propose in an appropriate way instead of disobeying Allah. If you wanted to know someone you can do that in the presence of relatives. You could ask about his manners and character. There are many methods to know the other person, that's why Islam has engagment beforem marriage.Not every man living with his father needs a permission but many do. It depends on the case."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, there's nothing wrong with eating from the same spoon so it's permissible."
Isam Rajab,Is it permissible to read namaz during the days of menses bcoz nowhere in quran it is stated to leave namaz and not read quran ..evrythg is so precisley stated then if this imp. matter is not it must be allowed to fast too..coz hadith can be changed by anyone and Bukhari was born so many years after Prophet. Who knwos wht was the ruling at that time. plz help.
Isam Rajab,"A non Muslim can be a mahrm to a muslim lady. Islam is not a condition in the Mahram.   I don't recommend you to travel for more than 3 hours in the plane alone even if it's ok with your husband, the prophet Sallallahualihi wasallam forbade that. I understand your situation is difficult but if you could find a mahram then it's much better, if not and you need to do the surgery then it's ok inshallah since you didn't have another option."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamualiakum,  the answer is: Yes, you can. Actually it's recommended since it's the nearest spot for a servant to his lord. the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said: during sujud &quot;prostration&quot; do your best in Dua."
Isam Rajab,To him it shall return. Before the day of Judgment the words of the Quran will be lifted from the papers and from the hearts of the ones who memorized it.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I ask Allah to help you becoming free inshallah soon. I'd like to remind you that people many times don't respond just because we've tried. Actually, when they refuse then here comes your job as a Muslima, remember that there were relatives to the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam didn't become muslims, the son of Nuh Peace be upon him didn't accept Islam so you need patience. I noticed from your words kind of weakness and you should be strong not against your family but towards your religion. You won't learn driving automatically. so you have to try learning and take the means to do so, don't wait for others to help you, remember you're not the first girl becomes muslim, there are many, and I do appreciate what you're doing and I only ask Allah to reward you because it's not an easy thing to become a muslim. Try to stay with your family but also try to overcome any difficulty that faces you."
Isam Rajab,"asalamo alaikum.  sheikh one of my friends recently asked whether it is allowed in islam to do scientific tests on animals , for e.g. to test a new medicine or to test how a mouse would react if it wouldnt sleep and they take out certain kind of nerves so it doesnt sleep anymore etc.. iis this permissible in islam ? jazakumullahu khair  wa asalamo alaikum"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The prophet sallallahualiahi wasallam forbade us to imitate the camel when we do sujud. So in the hadeeth he asked the Muslim to put his hands before his knees, other scholars came and said the hadeeth is flipped and the correct words is to put his knees before his hands because the knees of the camel are in his hands, therefore there are two opinions for the scholars. I personally put my hands before knees. That's what I felt the correct thing."
Isam Rajab,"The Sunnah is to pray the Jama'h and Juma'h in the Masjid. The more number you have, the better is the prayer, so if you have 50 people praying the Juma'h then they're better than 40 people prayer the Juma'h. This hadeeth is narrated by Ubai Ibn Ka'ab and recorded in Ahmad and Abu Dawood.   Yet if every group wanted to pray separetly then we'll have 100s of Jama'hs.   I can't though say it's forbidden to pray in that big building since you have met the conditions of Juma'h, but I don't recommend it at all especially if you have the ability to attend in the Masjid, and that's where the prayers should be held."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum wa rehmatullahi wa barakatu,  I was just checking this website  http://www.muslimconsumergroup.com  where it says that CHEESE IS NOT HALAL. Does that mean any kind of cheese or some specific ones?   Asalam o alikum wa rehmatullahi wa barakatu"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   In general, Allah Subhanahu Wata'la mentioned that the animals don't have sanity like humans, also Allah Subhanahu Wata'la mentioned that every thing glorifies Allah Subhanahu Wata'la even if we don't understand them. So you need to keep this in mind.   but there's no evidence forbades talking to animals so yes you can talk to them even if you'll not understand them. It was narrated that Uqba ibn A'mir Radiallahu Anh talked to the animals while opening Africa. And the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam told the people in Madina to command the snakes to leave the house so it's permissible to talk to animals."
Isam Rajab,"alsalam 3alaikum sheikh Isam, Surah Ahzab addresses the Prophet's wives (peace be upon them all), or the mothers of the believers.  To what extent do these commandments apply to common Muslimahs (for example, the verse about &quot;And stay in your homes&quot;).  I'm a little confused on this issue...as the Surah itself emphasizes that the Mothers of the Believers are not like common Muslim women.  may you please tell me: 1. what are the specific limitations that women today, especially in western cultures, should keep in mind? 2. is it permissible for a woman to work (lets say until she gets married, given that the work environment is an islamic one?) -- if so, is it advisable not to work? 3. could you recommend any books on the topic?  jazakAllah khair. walsalam 3alaikum."
Isam Rajab,You can choose not to eat by yourself as you can choose not to take medication. But to do it to smeone else then I can't give an answer as I told you earlier.
Isam Rajab,What is the women's jihad in Islam?
Isam Rajab,"I think I was asked this question previously yet I'll answer it anyway. Ya in Arabic is a letter(word) to call someone, so if you wanted to call someone you put ya before his name just like O in english. What do they mean exactly? I don't know you need to ask them because I don't know who they are and even if I know who they are I can't know their intentions!   The second statement means I sacrifice my soul for you O Messenger of Allah (Sallallahualaihi wasallam) and this is permissible. What's more beautiful than sacrificing your life for the sake of the Prophet Sallallahualaihi wasallam?  Hassan ibn Thabit Radiallahu Anh said in one line of his peotry that my father, my grandfather and my honor all is sacrificed for the honor of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam. But I don't think this is correct in our time since the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam died yet maybe they mean they strive to apply the Sunnah or follow the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam or defend him against the distortion. Again I can't tell you exactly what people mean when they say something, you need to ask them to get the correct answer."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   What do you mean by darood? after the prayer or before salam?  Dua is always recommended so I advise you to verify with the one said you should not read any dua."
Isam Rajab,"That's fine, she should be his (Best Friend) because she deserves the best companionship as the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam mentioned. So there's no problem when you say this."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If he doesn't intend to have a baby anymore then this is against the religion and you don't listen to him so you can stop taking the pill without his knowledge. But if he's doing this for a reason for sometime only then it's permissible and thus you have to obey him. I believe this issue will be resolved through mutual understanding and dialog not pushing the issue until there's no choice."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes it has to be 5 times but the stomach doesn't have to be empty!"
Isam Rajab,Are the following types of sandals allowed whilst in the state of Ihraam?    http://store1.yimg.com/I/peltzshoestore_1873_38258836 .
Isam Rajab,"Wa'alaikumussalam warahmatullah,   These terms are not from the Sunnah but rather People made them customary titles for the honored personalities.  You don't have to say this term before mentioning the name of the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam but you have to say the blessings and the prayers upon him.   sometimes people use these terms before the companions names or the great scholars of Islam, and again you don't have to do that. It's a customary thing."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wa barakatuh,   The girl should start Hijab when she reaches puberty but it's always better to start earlier to get used to it, the same thing applies to fasting. The only exception is the prayer since the Prophet Sallallahualiahi wasallam ordered Muslims to teach their children the prayer when they're 7 and punish them if they left it when they're 10. That's the only exception."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If they say Muhammad Sallallahualaihi wasallam then they say You and it's know that it meant the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam then it's ok it shouldn't be considered disrespect.   Actually what's consider disrespect is refering to him by SAW instead of Sallallahualaihi wasallam and some scholars considered this haram."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   I'm sorry but I can't tell if he was married or not, I don't have an authentic hadeeth says he was married and it's not mentioned in the Quran also so Allah knows best.   Yes it's true that he was given half of the beauty as the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam described him when he saw him during the trip of Miraaj."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum,  Can a sister highlite her hair?  Jazak Allah Khair"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Food is blessing from Allah Subhanahu Wata'ala and you should be appreciative. So it's always recommended to use it and not throw it. There are people starving to death in many places around the world. So you should remember this.    Yet if you know that no one will eat it and you tried your best to save it and you didn't mean to excess then it's permissible to throw it."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   I don't think there's a problem with it &quot;The light&quot; it doesn't sound wrong."
Isam Rajab,"Salam I have question about the rights of a wife? My husband doesn't work right now and says that he's not going to work as long as I don't work. I also have to do all housework even if I'm not feeling good with no help from him, he just sits on the computer all day or goes out with friends. Also my husband doesn't believe that we have to pray and hardly prays at all. He also doesn't always fasts when he is supose. I'm a revert of 2 years and I'm just now learning the way to pray because I found some sisters that are teaching me when they can. He also doesn't give me time to concentrate on reading a tafsir without him interupting every 2-5 min. I can't study Islam in my house without him having a problem. Also he doesn't want me to wear hijab, which I do, he says that it's only for extremist and he doesn't want me to be an extremist. Please can you advice what I'm to do?"
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum,  I am sorry Shaikh I know I suppose to ask you questions during the class, but there are a lot of students asking you questions and most of the time my questions remain unaswered. That is why I chose to ask you questions here rather than in class.  I am sorry if my questions annoy you.  Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum wa rehmatullahi wa barakatu,  I heard from people saying that Prophet Mohammad Sallaho Alaihi Wasallam said that seek knowledge, even if you have to go to China. And they said that knowledge means Duniya's knowledge. Is it a true Hadith ? if it is a true Hadith then is it Deen knowledge or Duniya's knowledge?  Asalam o alikum Wa rehmatullahi wa barakatu"
Isam Rajab,"A/salaam, i wanted to know if namaz would be permissable when you had done wudu before you put on nail polish and after that you had broken wudu, because the nail polish protects the nail from dirt keeping it clean underneath. Please reply, JAzak Allah."
Isam Rajab,Asalam alikum  Can you marry someone you抮e not attracted to? Say you抮e doing it for the sake of Allah- is that marriage valid even though you feel no attraction?
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu alaykum,  &quot;Ya bani israel....&quot; who are the children of Israel?"
Isam Rajab,"The Prophet Sallallahu alaihiwasallam wants people to remember Allah Subhanahuwata'la and learn as well, so whenever they pass by a circle of Thikr or Quran or knowledge they should sit and benefit from it."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, What is khana-e-kaba? Ali Radiallahu Anh was born in Makkah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Once a man becomes a Muslim all his sins are forgiven so it's ok to mention the sins he committed to show the blessings of Allah Subhanahu Wata'la and the favor of Allah upon his servants by guiding them. So if the purpose of mentioning the sin is to educate others and warn them then it should be permissible. In general, the sins should be concealed and not mentioned to others as the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam &quot;All my ummah is cured except those who announce their sins&quot;."
Isam Rajab,"assalamu alaikum, i went to a lecture once where we (this was a sister's gathering) were told that we are ALL beautiful because Allah created all things in good form. Is this true?  I assume that at least part of this talk was made because of the negative perceptions girls often have of themselves (ie my nose is too big, I'm too fat,  etc. etc) and the effect this has on self esteem.   Are muslims allowed to consider themselves to be unattractive or does this involve disrespecting Allah's creation or being ungrateful?  what about Julaybib? Wasn't he considered by the people to be less physically attractives (but was praised highly for his other characteristics).  Jazakallah."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum Wa rehmatullahi wa barakatu,  whatever happened after 9/11 they are really scared. Because I go to University and come back around Asr time. So they are really worried about me.   Now should I do niqab or just wear hijab ?   Asalam o alikum wa rehmatullahi wa baraktu"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You start with the right fingers as the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam used to start with the right side, the same thing applies to your hair, when the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam used to shave his head he starts with the right side. If you're dressed new clothes you say: اللهم لك الحمد أنت كسوتنيه أسألك من خيره وخير ما صنع لأجله، وأعوذ بك من شره وشر ما صنع لأجله the translation is: O Allah, Praise be to you. I ask you for its goodness and the goodness of what it has been made for, and I seek refuge with you from the evil of it and the evil of what it has been made for. You also say: الحمد لله الذي كساني هذا ورزقنيه من غير حول مني ولا قوة All praise is due to Allah Who clothed me this and provided it for me without any power from me."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   No that's not correct. They were destroyed because they rejected their Messenger (Lut) peace be upon him.    This issue (bisexual) is discussed in details in most of fiqh books. In general it's rare and once the person reaches the age of puberty then the matter is clear, if he grow a beard then he's a male, if she has the characteristics of female like the soft voice and the mensturation then she's a female. Once we know she's a female then she can't be with men as a male, or if he's a male then he can't be with the females since he's considered a male now. It's more rare to remain bisexual after the age of puberty and I don't like to talk about it unless there's a real case."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If he gave him Yes then it's Yes, how does the spouse know that it was out of anger? People are responsible of their actions.   The wali can suggest when is the marriage but the final word is to the wife."
Isam Rajab,I don't think it's inappropriate. There are some ahadith about the virtue of shaking hands with your muslim brother. Though they're weak but most scholars apply them in these situations. I don't think this is an exception.
Isam Rajab,i need a very good prayer that will very fast consider by the creator   please help i have family problem most of our family are witch and affect us please help me  from one of urs bros in Islam   Abdul Waheed Abdul Ganiyu   my mail id is  success4ever2006@yahoo.com  thanks
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   I don't understand how dua in congrigation is Bida'ah! The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam used to pray to Allah during Juma prayer (which is a congrigation) so is that Bida'h?"
Isam Rajab,Celebrating the birthday is not a religious activity so it should be ok to go there though some scholars consider it imitating the disbelievers and it's haram. I don't encourage it but I can't say it's prohibited.
Isam Rajab,"as salaamu alaykum  I sent a friend a sum amount of money overseas, about 1500$.  As for the currency exchange they recieved i think around 700 euros (not sure).  As of now the person is returning me the money but the currency rate overseas has risen and they have to pay a greater amount that they have recieved in order to make up the 1500$ that was sent to them by me.  Is this considered riba?  Or is there any sin involved in this if the person is paying more in order to equal the amount that they had recieved? And what about if they are doing it willingly?  Jazaakhullaah khayr  salaam"
Isam Rajab,Asalamu Alaikum sheikh...  Me and my friends debate about the Niqaab...and i want to know the correct answers according to the 4 mahhabs... My Question is ... Is Niqaab Wajid or Sunnah..(Strong Sunnah)  May Allah bless you..Ameen
Isam Rajab,"Walalikumussalam, The Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam mentioned that Asiya is in Paradise, and Allah Subhanahuwata'la mentioned her merits in the Quran, so we're sure that she's in Paradise, She was tortured by Firaon, so she should be considered as a martyer. There's no evidence that she escaped with Bani Israil."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Your husband should not ask you more than what he paid if you requested Khul'. Whatever was given as a gift shouldn't be taken back. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said :&quot;the one who takes back what he gives is like a dog threw up and then eat what he threw up&quot;. I'd like to advise you not to describe him as &quot;monster&quot; even if he truly was, for Allah says in a situation like this {And do not forget Liberality between yourselves}."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu alaykum Shaykh,  I am confused about the issue of awrah.  Nowadays many religious sisters are having their lectures recorded on tape and those tapes are being sold to both men and women.  Is there any flexibility on this issue?  Is it alright for men to listen to these lecture tapes hoping to benefit from the knowledge on them?  Please advise.  Hayakallah"
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu Alaikum wr wb  If a sister is engaged to a brother and he hasn't seen her hair, and it turns out she has very Few hair (can see the head totally) , would that be deceiving him into marriage?"
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu Alaikum  I'm suffer from waswasa from tiem to time. Sometimes such evil thoughts come to my mind, that i would rather have the earth swallow me than to speak them. Like I don't feel comfortable with my younger brother, I'll start thinking weird things...and they are not on purpose, the most disgusting thoughts cross my minds..once as soon a thought came, I slapped myself..I hate them...I usually just start reciting the quran...sayign seeking refuge with Allah...  I don't know how to get rid of these waswasa...thhey are just so evil. And I'm allhumdulilah practicing...and i feel very depressed that i can't get rid of these waswasa...they started hapening only very recently...what is the reason for such waswasa...is it that Allah is displeased with me...and He doesn't protect me frmo the shaytan anymore...?"
Isam Rajab,Would you please remind me with that answer as I don't remember it.   If you're under an impression then you could have come and checked it by yourself becaues maybe you have a wrong impression which may lead you to a wrong judgment that you may be held accountable for it on the day of judgement.   Maturidi people are not from Ahlussunah Wal Jama'h. Only deviant people consider them from Ahlussunah wal Jama'h. If they're from Ahlussunah Wal Jama'h they won't call them Muturidi.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Who says it's not safe to go inside the school during the recess? If someone said something for some reason that doesn't mean it's automatically valid.   If you really want a solution for your son's problem then first you have to ask yourself why he's in such school to begin with? Is it the only school? Can't he be home schooled? Did you go to the principal and demand him to accomodate your son's religious right which is guaranteed by the constitution?    Naming the Juz's is not from the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam or the companions, many companions used to divide the quran to 7 parts instead of 30 so you may not find a name for every single juz'."
Isam Rajab,"The Majority of schoalrs say you need to travel a minimum of 48 miles.   You can always make dua, but does this dua count as a dua of a traveler or not? there are two opinions and I believe you're not a traveler as long as you don't have the intention of traveling but rather you have the intention of studying even if you're allowed to shorten the prayer."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's not permissible to lie to make people laugh, the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said: &quot;Wow to the one who lies to make people laugh&quot;. So you should not lie even in your jokes. I believe this type of jokes is still untrue so it's better to be avoided but it's not exactly like telling a lie."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes it's permissible to name your unborn child. Companions were given nicknames by the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam while they were unmarried yet."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   The Sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam is that if he liked food he would eat it and if he didn't like it he doesn't eat from it but he doesn't complain. So this is in brief the explanation of the hadith. What people do (like being offended) if you didn't eat their food is exactly the opposite of the sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam. We learn from this hadith that you don't have to eat something you don't like (unlike what many people do). If your wife cooked something you don't like try to encourage her and praise her even if that's not exactly true but if this is happening on regular basis then you could simply tell her what you like to eat and what you don't like to eat. The same thing with people, I like it when people ask what do you like to eat? Which means they are trying to do their best.  So if I ask you what do you like to eat and I prepare it then you still don't like it I should not be offended at all because that's the best I could do. It's important to remember that the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam was not picky about his food and he used to eat olive oil with bread or vinegar with bread!    One of the best books which describes the eating habits of the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam is Zad Al Ma'd for Imam Ibn Al Qayim Rahimahullah.  If you read the book of food in Sahih Al Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawood, Attirmithi, Annasaie and Ibn Majah then you don't need any other book because you'll get all the eating habits of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I believe contacting Jinn is not allowed because Allah Subhanahu Wata'la created for them a different world and he created for us a different world. He hid them from us for a wisdom so we should not try to contact them. You may say but if it's a Muslim jinn then it could help me, well, how do you know if he's a muslim or not? Allah instructed us to seek help through prayer, patience, fasting and other Ibadat. He didn't instruct us to ask them for help. Whoever says it's permissible needs to provide an evidence and I don't know of any."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Allah doesn't hold somone accountable for things he's unaware of or doens't understand them. Therefore, in the Hadith of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam: &quot;The pen is lifted on three types of people&quot; and he mentioned of them: The one who has mental disease.   That's why the boy is not responsible to perform the Ibada until he reaches the age of puberty because before that he's unable to fully understand the commandments of Allah Subhanahu Wata'al.   So it depends on the brain damage, if it effects the ability to understand and perceive then yes they're not held accountable for the Ibadah, if it's only a disease or a seizure that comes and goes then they're still responsible."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You can recite it after Ruku but it's better to be said before Ruku. In saheeh Al Bukhari from Anas Radiallahu Anh that the Prophet Sallallahualaihi wasallam used to say it before ruku. Some scholars said you only recite it after the 15th of Ramadan but others said you can recite it year round."
Isam Rajab,"The center of Sham &quot;BiladuSham&quot; is the Aqsa Masjid, then you go north all the way to the borders of Turkey and you go east to the Euphrates river and south to the borders of Jordan. All 4 countries are included in this term."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes, it's permissible for Men to enjoy their female slaves without marrying them. There are many rulings about this that I don't see the point of disscussing them since we don't have slaves."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's not permissible to sell non Islamic books. Even the books of comparitive religions you need to be very careful when sell them if they're not fair to Islam.   The Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam so Omar reading from the Torah and he was very upset, let alone selling it."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Scholars explained this hadeeth of Ibn Abbas Radiallhu Anhuma which is mentioned in Saheeh Muslim. Most of them mentioned that it's not an excuse to combine the prayer.   Yet if your friend can drive the rulings from the hadeeth and he has knowledge in the book of Allah and the sunnah in all matters not only in this hadeeth then it could be considered as an excuse."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If this situation causes fitna then it should be avoided. If it's not then I don't see anything wrong with it. It depends on the people themselves. Sometimes permissible things become prohibited if they're used as means to commit sins."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It could be forbidden to prevent the evil from happenning. First you greet, then you talk and then you start disobeying Allah Subhanahu Wata'la. Maybe that's the reason. But there's no aya or hadith forbids that. Actually women used to greet the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam so in general it should be allowed but if the girl is young and the man is young also I believe it's better to be avoided."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Women don't pray when their period comes because Allah said so. That's why they don't pray.  Try to be smarter when such people ask you about subsidiary issue of Islam and take them to the essential thing: The oneness of Allah Subhanahu Wata'la.  What if she's convinced that it's suitable that women shouldn't pray during the menses yet she didn't believe? Therefore, you should always say Allah says so and if you don't know I can tell you if you have some time and you start talking about the greatness of Islam and the oneness of Allah instead of wasting your time discussing secondry issues.   I'm not a big fan of debates, yet you could tell her what do you think of the bible? Is is also ridiculous? when it says in the book of Leviticus Chapter 15: 19-25:    &quot;If a woman has a discharge, and the discharge from her body is blood, she shall be set apart seven days; and whoever touches her shall be unclean until evening. Everything that she lies on during her impurity shall be unclean; also everything that she sits on shall be unclean. Whoever thouches her bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. etc....&quot; Is this ridiculous?"
Isam Rajab,.....Saalaaamm  what's the reason for muslims not to eat Pork...is it because it's dirty and is it true that you'll get a disease????  salam
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   There are two opinions in this matter. Some scholars say you have to do the Fard before since the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said : &quot;Whoever fast Ramadan then 6 days...&quot; and the one who has fard to make up didn't fast Ramadan yet until he finishes those days. The other opinion says you don't have to make up all fard first but you can do the 6 days since Allah says the Quran { The same number of other days} and Aisha Radiallahu Anha used to make up the days of Ramdan in the next Sha'ban after 11 months due to her position of being the wife of the Prophet Sallallahualaihi wasallam. I lean towards the second opinion and I believe it's permissible to do the 6 days first."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahamatullahi Wabarakatuh,   If it's a washroon not a bathroom then you can say it there.  There are many ways to remember saying this dua. you could post it in front of the door so once you step out you'll remember it. or before you perform wudu remove all towls and once you're finished and you want to wipe your hands remember that you took the towl to say the dua so you'll say it inshallah."
Isam Rajab,It should be pure because it's from the sea.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   If the stunning didn't kill the animal then it's permissible to eat it. Scholars differed on the animal which doesn't have a stable life whether it's still permissible to eat or not. So even if that stunning made the animal looks like dead some scholars allowed eating it.   Insurance is not permissible because it is a sort of gambling. You pay a monthly payment for years and you may not get anything back, and you may pay 2 payments yet you get thousands of dollars. It's not permissible but in many cases you have no choice because it's the law."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, I don't know anywhere in the Quran where it says you have to respect the qalam.    Anyway, if this pencil is so expensive then you should return it to its origional owner. If it's not expensive then it may not require a special permission to be used and most likely the office won't mind taking it home so you can use it."
Isam Rajab,Asalamu alaikum sheikh  Inshallah i plan on going for ummrah and i am confused about the ihram. If im travelling from the US can i wear my ihram from the US and then do the niyyah at the meeqat on the plane or do I have to wear my ihram clothes on the plane to? When does ihram start when one wears the clothes or when one does the niyyah? and do they have to be done together?  Jazakullah khair in advance
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The correct pronounciation is أعوذ بالله This letter ذ could be translated as th or dh. It won't be pronounced correctly unless you take your toungue out between your teeth. Many people in Pakistand, Bangladish, etc.. don't do that and pronounce it incorrect. They pronounce it as Z which is a different letter."
Isam Rajab,"Assalaamu alaikum,  A sister led some sisters in prayers, and recited a surah in which there was a verse containing a place where sujood is recommended, but didnt do sujood.  Is it obligatory to do sajdah in prayer when you come across such an ayah?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, I'm sorry, this needs lots of time to read and understand exactly what happened. If you can wait then I'll give it sometime inshallah. I'll contact Abu Ilyaas then."
Isam Rajab,"In general I don't like hypothetical questions so if this case happens I don't believe the child will be automatically taken by social services, why the child is taken while his mother or his father is not?    Anyway, let's assume that this is the case then the answer is not to prevent them from having children but to provide them the good environment where they could learn their religion.  It's not a requirement for having children to be perfect or not to have any problem."
Isam Rajab,"Can Women visit Graveyard?  If yes ,when she visit the graveyard ,Does she also has to go to every grave and pray for that person like men do or she 'should only stand on her mehram's grave and pray there for the rest?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes she does, just like the sick who doesn't have to attend Jumah he'll still get the reward if he came and attended though he didn't have to."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's not haram because of impatience but actually the Prophet Sallallahualiahi wasallam forbade that but I don't know what's the reason behind it."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   She pays the Fidyah but when she's able to fast after several years then she has to make up the fasting she missed as well.   There's a difference of opinions regarding the pregnant who can't fast. Some scholars said she has to fast when she's able to and pay the fidyah, others said she has only to fast. Others said it depends whether she feared on herself or she feared on her baby.   So there is almost 4 opinions but that's only regarding the pregnant. Now when she's also planning to have another baby and she may be unable to fast for several years then there's also another issue which is comparing her to the one who can't fast at all so it's sufficient to pay the fidyah only or she can't and she has to fast when she's able to. What if she didn't get pregnant? what if pregnancy failed for some reason?   I briefed all that in the first line of my answer."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   There's a short time where the sun sets and it doesn't rise, so maybe that's the time the Messenger Sallallahualihai wasallam mentioned.    Human beings due to their ignorance think that the prostration of the sun is similar to their prostration which requires tranquility and so, while the sun is different.   When the Messenger Sallallahualihai wasallam mention underneath the throne, that doesn't mean it's physically or exactly, but it could mean in parallel but the throne is over it thousands of miles.   Scientifically astronomers agree now that the sun will rise from the west one day, they just don't know when.   I don't see any problem with this hadeeth, if we don't understand it, we believe in it."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes you can. There's no evidence forbids that."
Isam Rajab,Will your wuduu still be valid if you sleep for 2-3 hours or even 1 hour and you know that when you sleep you don't pass out gas?
Isam Rajab,Excuse my ignorance I still don't get it.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Yes she needs to seek his permission.  She can ask him beforehand and she should also know what he allows and what he doesn't allow because the husband may already tell her that you're allowed to go here and there so she doesn't need his permission again, but if she's suspecting then she definately should seek his permission."
Isam Rajab,"I think this is the fourth question about the same issue, and I'm repeating the same answer, please follow your community. If they follow Isna then follow isna as well."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Wilayah of marriage is not pick and choose! Her father should be her wali unless there's a legitimate reason to remove this Wilayah from him, then it goes to the nearest relative. If there's no family memeber then the judge or his representative (Islamic Center) could determin who's the wali. She can choose someone but with the approval of the Islamic authority."
Isam Rajab,It's wajib to memorize the minimum that could help you perform the obligatory prayer. Whatever beyond that is recommended.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, There's no Ijma' at all! Actually there are many opinions: One opinion says if you touch with desire only then your wudu is invalid, another opinion says your wudu will not be invalidated by touching a foreign woman and there's also the opinion of Imam Ashafie Rahimahullah.   The aya says {Our you touched women}. &quot;Touching&quot; here could mean the literal touching and it could mean the sexual intercourse. The other evidence is that the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam used to kiss his wives before he goes out to pray and he doesn't perform wudu. So there's an aya and there's the hadith.  Each scholar has an evidence to support his opinion. You should choose what you believe is correct based on the evidences not what you believe is easier for you. I believe the correct opinion is that touching doesn't invalidate at all."
Isam Rajab,"Salam sheikh,  is it true a woman has to bury her placenta after she gives brith?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes you can't ask forgiveness for them if they're not muslims. Allah stated that clearly in the Quran in Surat Attawbah. 9:113."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I didn't see them commenting on that, remember that it's possible to say La Quwata Illa Billah, and also La Hawla Illa billah, as you say: Bismillah, or Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. and this happened before the time of the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam so there was no specific dua."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamualaykum I know Riyaa is minor shirk. Im not sure what constitutes riyaa, for example if im at the mosque ill pray the sunnah prayer, but I dont do it all the time at home would this constitute ar-riyaa bc im doing it when ppl are around, although that is not my intention, its just that whenever i see someone do a good deed it just motivates me to do it i.e praying the sunnah prayer at the Masjid."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   There's a rule in Principles of Fiqh called &quot;affirmation takes precedence over negation&quot;. So if one companion denied something and another companion affirmed it we take the one who affairmed it, the one who denies didn't see and the one who affirms saw so we take his narration or his opinion.   Imam Al Bukhari Rahimahullah narrates what's authentic for him but that doesn't mean anything else which is not mentioned is not authentic. No doubt there are authentic narrations that the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam raised his hands with takbir before Ruku and after ruku and that's the opinion of many scholars inclduing Ashafie and Ahmad Rahimahumallah."
Isam Rajab,Can a woman wear loose pants outside instead of an Abaya?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Welcome to Islam. May Allah Subhanahu Wata'la grant you steadfastness on the currect path.  It's permissible to fast with a group in the situation you mentioned and it could be included in the aya where Allah Subhanahu Wata'la says 5:2 {Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwa (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression}. Though it has to be mentioned that the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam didn't do it."
Isam Rajab,"Let's say this is true, what does that mean? you don't have to pray? you don't have to do the worship?    So God sends down the quran for some people and then talks to the hearts of others? He tells us to pray but you were chosen so you don't have to pray?  Even the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam did all types of Ibada even more than other people. You need lots of help. I pray for you and I advise you to read Quran and do more Ibada, you might need the help of some educated people."
Isam Rajab,No she's not. Unless she admits that she did it or 4 witnesses testify that they saw her doing that thing.
Isam Rajab,"As Salaam Alaykum Shaikh,  In Islam men and women both have rights.  Men, by ALLAH'S leave have the right to marry more than one wife.  In America, what can a husband Shaikh/Imam or anyone do if a wife chooses to abandon her marriage due to polygamy?  Our marital contracts arent recognized if their not in compliance with US law. Bottom line, in the US she can lawfully accuse you of bigamy.  Brothers are giving a dowry, and when the woman wants out she can give a million reasons why and obtain a khula?  or she can just leave, take you to court, take your money, and start all over somewhere else?  Beside ALLAH'S protection, what protcetion do we as men have in this country when we encounter this type of woman?  what advice can you give to brothers and sisters who find themselves in this type of situation?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If you want to know then you should not give a judgment already! Because you said: &quot;I just can't imagine Muslims being in that atmosphere&quot;. This won't help you getting the correct answer without being biased though I know where you're coming from and why you're saying this. Anyway, If you're going to the Gym or to any other place where there are women undressed properly then it depends on the intention if your intention is to do good like exercise and strengthening your body then it's permissible as long as the good overweighes the evil and you have no better place to go like an Islamic gym or having the tools at home because this may not be possible for many people. But if that was possible then yes it becomes prohibited."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah, I'm sorry but I don't have this book as well. I heard about it long time ago but I was not interested in it because I don't really care about the books of replies and refutations as I have more important things to do and lots of knowledge to learn. This is my advice to you as well. Start with the book of Allah Subhanahu Wata'la and the Hadith of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam, that's more benificial for you inshallah. Allah will ask you about your own deeds not about other people's deeds. Once you become a scholar inshallah and people wait from you to guide them then you can tell them read the book of this person and don't read the book of that person."
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu Alaikum  I have very terrible habit of making vows whenever I feel guilty. So one day I missed my fajr twice in a row, I was so upset. I went on the internet and I read that one should sleep early, one should not eat late and one should pray isha early and go to sleep afterwards. Well I actually made a vow to do all of those. Like for example I said  Wallahi I won't eat after 10 Wallahi I will be in bed after 10 Wallahi I wil pray isha at 9  So now I'm really have a hard time keeping it up and realy regret it. And I couldnt. Now I feel much worse. As I have broken my vows. So what should I do?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes there's.   It's narrated in Sunan of Abi Dawood and many scholars mentioned that the hadith isweak, others said it's a sound hadeeth. Either way you can't tell someone who's doing it that he's doing bida' as there's a strong hadith about it.   I don't encourage doing it as no one of the companions or successors recommended it or even mentioned it. Some scholars said regardless of the authenticity of the hadith the way it's done is different so it shouldn't be performed."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Fiance is considered a strange man, the only difference is that he's promise of marriage, so he can't meet with her in seclusion, he can't see her hair or body and so on."
Isam Rajab,"I think only the fools (I'm sure you're not one of them) think there's a contradition in this ayah. The criminal thinks sentencing him to death is a crime and injustice while all society knows it's justice.  It's of Allah's mercy that he punishes those who deserve punishment. It's Allah's mercy that who deserves guidance will be guided. Otherwise, if everyone will be guided whether they deserved or not, everybody will be rewarded whether they did good or not then there's no mercy and no justice. As I said, the fools only (And I'm sure you're not one of them) think there's a contradition in this ayah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's permissible for the man to marry the same woman he fornicated with if they both repented to Allah Subhanahu Wata'la. If he knows that she didnt' repent then he shouldn't marry her, and if she knows he is not going to repent then she shouldn't marry him As Allah mentioned in the beginning of Surat Annur. The woman shouldn't be married during the pregnancy to any one except to the one who she fornicated with bearing in mind the condition I mentioned.   Those parents should be advised that it's better to cover up the shame before Allah Subhanahu Wata'la instead of focusing on people."
Isam Rajab,"وعليكم السلام The day of Judgment will be fifty thousand years. But the ruglar days in heavens are 1000 years. That's what's mentioned in Surat Al Ma'arij 4 and in Surat Al Hajj ayah 47 as well. Only a liar or a fool would think that there's a contradiction in the Quran, unlike the bible where it's full of contradictions."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, Keep making up fasting until you're satisfied that you made up all the fast."
Isam Rajab,"as salaamu alaykum wa rahmatullah  are you allowed to read quran whilst you are on your periods? or memorize portions? the reason why im asking this is that some scholars say yes and others say no, and i dont know which opinion is the soundest. also, when someone starts to read quran on a daily basis, or if someone is a hafidhah its very difficult to get into a routine because it is disrupted every single month for like 7days.  jazakallah khaira"
Isam Rajab,"Esselam Elaykum  Sheykh is it haraam for a woman to drive or go to college here in the west? I want to go to college and I swear I don't want to go for any negative reason and Allah knows my intention, but my father doesn't want me to go because he fears anything might happen to me, and my brother doesn't want me to drive cuz he says what if I crash and die and they don't know where I am that way I will mess up their reputation, but I don't see anything wrong. If anything was meant to happen it's because Allah wanted it to happen, nothing more or less, this doesn't seem to satisfy them what would you advise me, I feel that my rights are being violated and my father and brother aren't giving me my full rights, if my brother is to be educated then I'm to be educated too. Please sheykh advise me, I want to go to college and get a degree and have a halal earning, nothing more, not to show off or anything like that, as I do know no one is superior but Allah. And please pray for me.  may Allah reward you."
Isam Rajab,Does letting out of abnoxious burps during the salaat invalidate the wudu' or the salaat?. Shokran
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   No it's not."
Isam Rajab,According to your description the hair on the cheek is shaved and that's not permissible.
Isam Rajab,I asked you specifically what are you looking for? It's true that there ar forged ahadeeth. If you already know it's forged then it's forbidden to act upon them.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Fearing Allah is the key. Doing good deeds. Knowing the reward that Allah prepared for good doers. Knowledge of the status of the Muslim when he dies and how the angels wil come taking his soul smoothly.    If you obey Allah, treat people with a good manner then you shouldn't fear death."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I assume you mean the birthday of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam. Let's say for the sake of argument this is the opinion of Ibn Hajar, Nawawi, and all other respected scholars. Do they have an evidence? what about other respected scholars like the 4 great Imams, Ibn Kathir and others? The matter is not blind following. Whoever has a proof we'll follow him. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam never celebrated it nor asked to celebrate it, neither did the companions nor their successors. So it's obvious."
Isam Rajab,"I think the Shaykh forgot to answer my second question:  2. If there is a man (and no other men), can he lead a woman (who is not his mehram) in Salaat?"
Isam Rajab,yes
Isam Rajab,"It depends on the time and place. It goes back to the custom of people, in general, the Muslim should keep the modesty and respect in front of people but if it was a common thing then he may kiss her on her cheek, but this may not be suitable in other places so it can't be done there."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes the children of Adam used to marry each other. There's no other way to reproduction at their time."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Although I don't recommend it but yes in that case it's permissible to ask someone to draw the images for children and it's better to be a non muslim because if images are allowed for children that doesn't make it allowed for adults!   Drawing with computer is better than doing it with pen since the computer is in the middle while with the pen it'd done directly by the person himself."
Isam Rajab,"Assalam-o-Alaikum   is there any reward for doing umrah in ramadan?  i have given the option going for umrah either in ramadan or now? i am just scared, i heard theres too much crowd in ramdan and sometime u dont even get a place inside Haram Sharif. please advice what would be the best option to choose Insha 'Allah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Suhoor is recommended and a blessing as the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam mentioned but it's not a condition for fasting.  As long as you make up your intention to fast then that's enough. In regards to optional fasting like monday and thursday some scholars said you don't have to make up your intention according to the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam when he used to ask about food and when there's not he used to remain fasting."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam   If you insert or sniff the water in your nose then how could you take it out with one finger?    You don't have to do that anyway, but as long as you take it out then it should be sufficient."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   I'm not sure if the Shaikh Rahimahullah said that or not because I don't have either books.  At any rate, scholars differend on excusing the ignorant if he committed shirk or not."
Isam Rajab,"In general, fasting friday should be proceded by fasting thursday or followed by fasting saturday unless there's a specific virtue or reason like the 6 days of shawal and Arafah, in this case it's permissible to fast friday alone."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes women can become scholars and there are Muslim women who are scholars and there was scholars of Muslim women just like Aisha Radiallahu Anha who had more knowledge than most of the male companions of the Prophet Sallallahualaihi wasallam. It's untrue that Islamic Universities don't allow women to learn Islam, maybe some universities don't have the means to open the door for both genders but there are many universities where Islam is taught for womenjust like Al Azhar in Egypt and Women school in Madinah, I'm not sure if Umm Al Qura university in Makkah has a branch for women. It's untrue that you need to learn Islam through your male relative, that's what the bible teaches not Islam!"
Isam Rajab,"Salaam u alaikum  I tend to suffer a lot of pre-seminal leakage, just by looking at women or even thinking about the opossite sex. My question is that is it obligatory to wash the whole penis and testicles - - or is it just sufficient for me to get rid of the impurity off the end of my penis my cleaning it with a wet tissue?   Jazak'Allah Khairan Wasalaam u alaikum"
Isam Rajab,"Don't buy an alarm with snooze button. Why you set the alarm on a specific time anyway if you're going to use the snooze button?  If you don't have any alarm without the snooze button then just deactivate it, break it. Just forget that there's a snooze button."
Isam Rajab,"As-S鈒amu Alaykum,  I am wondering how one reconciles between two particular ahadeeth, I couldn't find the exact wording of one of them, but I believe it is in either Bukhari or Muslim and it is about how some Prophets would come on the Day of Judgement with no followers.  How do we reconcile that hadeeth with this one: &quot;'Abdull鈎 bin Mas'鹍 (may Allaah be pleased with him) reported: Messenger of All鈎 (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said, &quot;Never a Prophet had been sent before me by All鈎 to his people but he had, among his people, (his) disciples and companions, who followd his ways and obeyed his command.  Then there came after them their successors who proclaimed what they did not practise, and practised what they were not commanded to do.  And (he) who strove against them with his hand is a believer; he who strove against them with his tongue is a believer; and he who strove against them with his heart is a believer; and beyond that there is no grain of Faith.&quot; [Muslim]  Sorry for not finding the exact text of the first hadeeth.  J鈠akumAll鈎u Khayr鈔."
Isam Rajab,"assalaamu aliakum.  Im a 16 year old muslim sister who is thinking about marriage. I am already interested in a religious muslim brother thats the same age as me and goes to the same school. Im pretty sure he doesnt know that im interested in him and i dont know how to approach this situation. I have been told to get to know him through his friends, but what if friends are all guys? How am i supposed to deal with this situation? JazakAllahu khair sheikh."
Isam Rajab,"Akhi you made it certainty while it's not, you say from experience you will miss fajr. Remember that your body responds to what you dectate.So if you think you won't wake up then that's what you'll get! But if you struggle then you'll definately wake up. I already told you that scientifcally you don't need more than 6 hours of sleep everyday. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam never slept over 5 consecutive hours! No one specified the hours but if you analyze his sunnah and the way he used to pray qiamullail you'll come up to this conclusion. I didn't say it'll be very easy. Yes you may struggle at the beginning but I'll never recommend someone to stay awake to pray fajr and then sleeps. This is neither recommended Islamically nor scientifically.   So again, sleep right after Isha, turn on the alarm. Ask someone also to call you. First day you may miss the prayer and you may not. Second day you shouldn't miss the prayer. You may struggle for a week but then I'm sure you'll be fine."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum WR WB,  I heard from people saying that even a new born non muslim baby will go to hell. And my question was always that the new born baby did not do anything, then why he/she go to hell? And the answer I always got from them was: &quot;I don't know&quot;  Can you please explain this to me. is it true ? if yes can you tell me the reason of it?  Asalam o alikum wr wb"
Isam Rajab,can i rent my house to the bank? is this halal or haram?  thanks
Isam Rajab,"salam i wanted to know how to deal with a very deeply troubling problem that i am experiencing.  i was married to a man whom i loved very much and he loved me.  we tried every way possible to get our families to understand that we really wanted to be together but unfortunately, they made so many problems for us that our marriage did not survive.  i was unable to leave my family and he was unable to leave his - regardless of the problems that they created for us.  it has been almost a year since the divorce and i have remarried.  the man im married to now is also wonderful and alhumdulillah, he really loves me too.  the problem is that i sometimes compare the two and i get very depressed when i go to a place or see an object that reminds me of my ex-husband.  even now, i have not stopped loving him (my ex). but my husband now doesnt know this, he thinks that i get into bad moods or become very quiet with him for other reasons. i dont want him to know that im still thinking about and regretting my failed marriage.  i want to be happy today and stop thinking about the past.  if it were possible, i would remarry my ex-husband, but i cant.  i dont want to think like this because my new husband is amazing and he does everything for me.  i just feel like i cant let go of the past - no matter how much i try.  what should i do? salam"
Isam Rajab,"I believe you know the answer better since you were able to dig in and find a narration about a different recitation.   In both most authentic books of Sunnah, Sahih Al Bukhari and Sahih Muslim the Messenger Peace be upon him commanded the companions may Allah be pleased with them not to kill a woman nor a child nor a religious person who is in his temple nor an old man.  AlMighty God says in the Quran 2:190 {And fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you and transgress not} So we kill those who want to kill us not everybody! So I believe the answer is clear."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   You don't have to have an aya or hadeeth for every single action you do to know whether it's haram or halal! Our religion is not that difficult alhamdulillah. The normal actions we do we can do them unless there's an aya or hadeeth forbids that. So instead of asking is there an aya or hadeeth you can ask is there any aya or hadeeth forbids that? and the answer is: NO, there's not.    The Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam forbade for women removing the eyebrow only and he said the one that does that is cursed but he didn't mention all the body of women."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The rights of parents and husband overlap.  The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said about the husband: &quot;If I were to order someone to prostrate to someone I would've ordered the wife to prostrate to her husband&quot; while he didn't say that to the mother.   On the other hand the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said that the mother is more worthy of the good companionship than anybody else including the husband.   So if there's something that upsests some and pleases others then find the nearest to Allah and do it."
Isam Rajab,"Ya Shaikh, how can I ask my brothers to go to the mosque to pray? They pray all their prayers at home, mostly on their own. I'm sure they know their obligations, should I still talk to them?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   This word &quot;Khalifah&quot; has more than one meaning, and maybe that's why you're little bit confused. Scholars interpreted the ayah based on the difference of meanings for this word. The political meaning of Caliphah as a head of state didn't appear until the death of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam so you know that it's not meant at all in the ayah. Allah Subhanahu Wata'la used this term in other ayat like: 7:169: {And a generation hath  succeeded  them who inherited the scriptures}. The same is true in Ayah 59 of Surat Maryam 19:59: {Now there hath  succeeded  them a later generation} Thus the meaning of Khalifah: people who'll be succeeded generation after generation. Another meaning for this word is a deputy who acts on behalf of the king or ruler. And some scholars discussed this if it's a correct meaning or not from the fact that Allah Subhanahu Wata'la wanted us to do certain actions on this earth as He instructed us. I advise you to read more books not only Al Qurtubi. Ibn Kathir Rahimahullah discussed this very well. The same did Ibn Jarir Attabari Rahimahullah. And I believe both books are translated or atl east the book of Ibn Kathir."
Isam Rajab,What is the ruling on marriage for the one who does not fear zina (fornication) as such but falls into masturbation or fears commiting it?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Excuse my ignorance in this matter, I don't know what exactly is &quot;tan&quot;."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The night of the 15th of Sha'ban is a special night. However, celebrating it the way you mentioned is Bid'ah as it was not done by the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam nor his companions and we're guided by following them."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   No, that's not a successful way so don't do it. Be honest to yourself and use what Allah and His Messenger has mentioned."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamualaikum Syaikh,    I had 3 miscarriages. I heard a hadith of S.a.w saying that whosoever had lost 3 child, her place is in jannah. A women stood up and asked about how about 2, and s.a.w said even for her and in some hadith even for 1.    My concern is that, is it for a live born child who passed away or even for miscarriages like mine. All the miscarriages lasted upto around 7-8 weeks by which the fetal heart stops but the pregnancy continues. i had to go through the pain of D &amp; C because the fetus is dead. Will i get my unborn child in the jannah and am i included as an example of the hadith ?     Jazakallah .   MAy Allah bless you always for this strong effort ."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, I already told you according to the second opinion yes he has to make tawbah and shahada because he was kafir when he didn't pray. According to the majority of shcolars no he doesn't have to make shahada but of course he has to make tawba and re-pray the missing prayers."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, And why don't you ask them to reply saying Wa'alaikum Assalam? Let them know the virtues of this greeting. After you remind them and ask them to reply, if they still insist on saying hi, then you have the choice, but I wouldn't leave it since it's the sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam and I don't want to deprive myself from the reward. If people don't want it, that's their problem not mine."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, Most likely they won't be under one khalifa since there'll be a fighting before his advent and an army from Syria will be sent to kill him which is not from the same leadership in Arabia. So there'll be different rulers. Also when he comes, he'll fill earth with justice which contradicts having one khalifa."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Istikhara is to ask Allah Subhanahu Wata'la to choose for you. You don't do Istikhara to sin against Allah Subhanahu Wata'la! Allah mentioned in the Quran that whatever evil we do it's because of what our hands have earned. Allah Subhanahu Wata'la doesn't approve the evil and doesn't like it."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Playing card is like any other game in general, it should be permissible unless there's something forbidden involved or there's an evidence to forbid it. So in principle it should be permissible. However, many times it causes animosity in the hearts unlike other games or sports and it causes people to waste lots of times. So whenever these things are there then it's haram.   Many scholars forbade chess because it wastes lots of time and it's made of idols. Other than that, I don't know any evidence from the book of Allah or the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam to forbid it. Though it's the opinion of Ali Radiallahu Anh, Ashafie and others."
Isam Rajab,"1- We have to understand that the rulings of Islam comes from 2 sources: Quran and Sunnah, so if someone said: &quot;Where does it say this in the Quran?&quot; I suggest you stop the discussion and teach them the essentials of religion first. 2- when we say: &quot;only one hadeeth&quot;. what do we mean by that? do we need at least 2 or 3? Subhanallah! 3- When Imam Ibn Hazm rahimahullah argued about Music, he didn't bring the argument these people are brining! because he knew it's incorrect! he simply douted the authenticity of the Hadeeth. It's understood that whenever there's a general ruling from the prophet sallallahu alaihiwassalm, it remains general unless there's another hadeeth or statement limits the generality of this verdict. This is a rule all scholars and most of student of knowledge know from the principles of Fiqh.  4- It's incorrect that this is the only hadeeth. When Abu bakr entered the house of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and he saw two girls playing with duff, he denied that, and he said: the pipe of devil in the house of the messenger of Allah! yet, the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam allowed for them, not because music is Halal, but because it was duff, and it was Eid, so it was understood by the companions that it's Haram. And the prophet sallallahu aliahi wasallam didn't tell Abu bakr: Why you're banning something that's halal! However, there are two separate issues: Music, and Singing. Singing is allowed with certain conditions but not music."
Isam Rajab,"You mentioned that this is a mining company, so in principle the work of this company is permissible. Therefore, your share should be halal even if the company itself was involved in some Riba transactions. Of course it's up to you if you wanted to sell these shares but you don't have to. You should advise your father so mention it to him in a nice way that there is interest in the account where is it going? Even if he keeps it as long as your job is a lawful job then this will not effect you inshallah. Of course that's not the best scenario but keep in mind that he's your father and maybe inshallah you'll be able eventually to eliminate all the interest."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   Yes I'm saying again that this marriage in principle is acceptable. In Zawaj Al Misyar there has to be a wali, witnesses and Mahr, the only thing is that the wife gives up her right of accomodation and maybe also her right of being provided for. So again all conditions of marriage are applied while in Zawaj Al Muta' there're no witnesses or wali and also it's temporary while it's forbidden in marriage to mention that it's temporary. So there are huge differences between the two marriages.   Marriage is supposed to be announced so people know that those two couples are married and they're not fornicating. Yet if they choose not to announce the marriage then it's up to them as long as there were two witnesses.  It's not a condition of marriage to seek the first wife's permission.    Mostly they don't announce marriage in Zawaj Al Misyar and also in most cases the wife chooses to stay at her parents' house and that's the only difference between the regular marriage and this type of marriage."
Isam Rajab,"The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said: &quot;The Imam is only assigned to be followed so when he says takbir you say takbir, when he bows you bow.....&quot;    So if the Imam said Tasleem then you don't wait but you have to finish after him because you're following him."
Isam Rajab,as salam aliekum Imam  There is a hadith in Sahih Bukhari saying that the Prophet [s] stood up for a dead jew while his funeral sessionw as passing by.  Do you know the full hadith?  And can you explain why did the Prophet stood up since jews are cursed people and should be hated.
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum,  When you start reciting the Quran, do you have to finish it within 2 months?   Jazak Allah Khair  Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   This collection is by Imam Attirmithi no doubt. It's verified and authenticated by Ashaykh Al Albani Rahimahullah. Maybe you're mentioning the english translation. I don't really know I haven't looked at the english translation."
Isam Rajab,Can you pray two raka'ah nafl salaah with more than one intention? Like you have the intention of haajah as well as shukr?
Isam Rajab,"As long as they knew they were brestfed by the same woman, then they have to be separated, it doesn't have to be at the same time. Even if they couldn't verify the minimum amount of each time they were breastfed. This incident happened at the time of the prophet sallallahu aliahi wasallam and he ordered the couples to be separated, the man said: O messenger of Allah, maybe she was wrong! The Prophet sallallahu aliahi wasallam didn't verify the number required."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It doesn't have to intoxicate you to become haram. The Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam said if a lot of it intoxicates you then few of it is forbidden. So it's forbidden."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu alaikum, How would one clean this: a large TILE bathroom floor on which impurities have fallen (urine, etc) and have spread. For example, one knows for certain that urine has fallen on the floor in various parts, but it wasn't cleaned in an &quot;Islamic manner&quot; and now people have walked over the area with wet slippers and thus transfered the filth to other areas. Since the floor is both tile and grout (rough substance), I was told that one must remove all traces of the impure material and then POUR water over the entire effected area. In western homes, it is difficult to pour water over large areas because the homes are not constructed in a manner that allows this (ie water will seep into the spaces between the wall and floor. this happened to me and was quite a problem).   I haven't really heard of muslims in this country doing this at all. People seem to just wipe their floors with wet cloths.  In my home, we are wearing slippers to keep our feet clean, but it would be more convenient for us and less confusing for guests if we didn't need slippers. What about wood floors? Jazakallah."
Isam Rajab,"Wa'alaikumessalam, It's permissible to use the nail polish but after you perform Wudu.  washing the hands is obligatory, when you wash your hands to the elbows, you have to wash your entire hand from the tip of your fingers to the elbows, and that includes nails. Wiping on the socks or the Khuf is an exception, and in religion we don't do Qiyas according to the exceptions!"
Isam Rajab,salam-o-alaykum  i met a girl thru internet and now want to marry her. i herd peple teling that there will be no barakah in such mariage. please advise with the evedences.   jazakalah khair
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   This is a known opinion for some scholars because the reason for forbidding picuters is the resembling of Allah's creature and once this cause is gone then the prohibition is also gone."
Isam Rajab,"Ok, it seems that my answer was confusing or to be more clear, my answer was wrong.   Those children are not mahrams to each other, but the children of the wife are mahrams to their stepfather and the children of the husband are mahrams to their stepmother.  I hope this removes the confusion. Thank you Olivia."
Isam Rajab,Asalam o3alaikum wara7matulahi wabarakatuh  I have explained to someone the reason of not celebrating the prophet's birthday using evidence from Quran and Sunnah i got the following Response even after much discusiion   &quot;all i am saying how can celebrating prophet's birthday salahialayhiwasalam be bidha? were in the quran it says it not alwd? wat we exactly do during his birthday is  read the quraan do hamd read nasheeds send salams uponhim  some people fast thank allha for sending his habeeb in dunya thank allha for making us the belessd umha of his beloved nabi let me give u example if we love someone toooooooooo much and we love tht person the most in this world and the next then we will neva forget tht day and tht day for us wil not be just any day no were in the quran it is it sin to celebrate we dont sing dance or do somthing against islam on his birthday unless some people think it is gunna to fast read quran  nasheeds or send salaams upon him &quot;  I am do not know how to respond to this Question in which manner?  Asalam o3alaikum wara7matulahi wabarakatuh
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If that's your major and you can't teach without joining then you have no choice but to do it."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I'm sorry but I can't do that here. It's a long issue, I can provide an answer for you but I need at least a week, I have many important things to take care of. So if you can wait I have no problem, coordinate with Abu Ilyaas and I'll provide an answer for you inshallah."
Isam Rajab,salam...  i just want to know if a women can show her legs ... meaning her hair is cover and she wears abayo but during the summer time it's kind of hot...so can she wear sandels?  jazzakamallahu khair
Isam Rajab,Does the hair removal for men extend to the belly button? Jazakallah khayr.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's permissible to think of remarrying but you can't disclose this intention to anyone, and no one could propose to you clearly while you are in the iddah. After the Idda you could announce that."
Isam Rajab,"Salamu alaikum, Is it ok for a woman who is ugly to pray for a husband who is good-looking?  Is it a practical dua?  This sister is sick of being rejected because of not being beautiful (even by average-looking men) and now she asks Allah to give her someone who is good not only to satisfy her desire but also to show people that Alllah can give good to whoever He wants. She does want a righteous husband though, but she is sick of people telling her that she is not beautiful enough."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Usually the matter will be clear once they reach the age of puberty. If he had the signs of adulthood for a male like hair around the face or so then he's treated as a male, and if she has the signs of adulthood for a female like menses or so then she's a female. I don't remember anything from the ahadith becasue this case is very rare."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   there are few ahadith mentioned about athan and Iqama for the new born babies, but all of them considered daief according to shaikh Albani Rahimahullah. However, some scholars considered it sunnah and they mentioned it in their books like Ibn Al Qayim Rahimahullah."
Isam Rajab,"As salam alikum    my self sharique my elder sister is going to marry in may in this year, i want to know her marriage life will successful or nor by istekhara. her name is ANJUM AFROZ and mummy name is SAYEEDA BANO and her fancy's name is FAZAL KHAN and he's mummy name is SAJIBUNNISA. my sister is high school teacher and her fancy is in army at civilian departement. my family belongs to nagpur in maharashtra in india and her fancy is from uttar dinajpur in bangal in india.plz tell me about her marriage life by istekhara or tell me the site s for istekhara  thanking u  khuda hafiz"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The same form: 2 Rak'at with takbir but without the Khutbah. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said: &quot;Come to prayer with tranquility, and pray whatever you attend, but you make up whatever you miss&quot;."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I won't be able to give you a clear answer since I believe it's allowed even without Jihaad or Walimaa. The Prophet Sallallahualaihi wasallam said واضربوا he didn't say واضربن it's a clear word for males not females. So I advise you to ask someone who follows that opinion."
Isam Rajab,Is wearing the latest style and having to have the 'best' of everything and wanting to wear only the 'best' mean you are immitating the kufar?  By best I mean whatever pop culture says you should wear like baggy jeans and name brand shoes and spacific way of wearing the clothes as if they are in a music video.   Please give me some daleel.   JazakAllahu khairan.   Asalaam Alaikum
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If someone studied hard colleges would love to have him/her. They may even pay him just to study with them. The problem is that we tend sometimes to think of the wrong things only and we forget what Allah Subhanahu Wata'la has given us of halal ways."
Isam Rajab,"Assalaam alaykum   I have 3 questions which I have been unable to find the answer.  1) When you donate to any non-profit organization, i.e. masjid or Islamic relief, you receive a receipt that you can submit to deduct if you're itemizing your taxes. I have not been submitting it because I don't know if it's acceptable Islamically.  My intention was to donate purely for that cause for the sake of Allah (SWT).  Am I correct in this opinion?  2) There is a member in my family who is in debt. It is a significant and large amount. Unfortunately, the individual is hesitant to take this money from me  in the form of sadaqah. Is it better that I give all I can to my family to help repay this debt quickly rather than donating money to help with the construction of a masjid or relief organizations?   3) I delay my witr prayer on purpose a majority of the time so that I can offer it during the last third of the night. Sometimes, I wake up late and am able to offer my fajr prayers. Should I then, offer my make-up witr prayers after or before offering my fajr prayers?   Insha-Allah, I hope you can direct me in the right direction. Jazak Allah Khair"
Isam Rajab,"Is it allowed for a husband to force his opinion on an issue on his wife even though she does not hold the same opinion?  Keeping in mind that there are permissible differences with regards to these issues.  Like for example, can he force his wife to wear niqaab beause he thinks it is fard even though she does not hold the same opinion?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I don't know this hadith and the meaning also doesn't sound right. I can't say it contradicts the sayings of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam but it somehow underestimates fighting the enemies. Also the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said the greatest jihad is to say the truthful word before an unjust ruler so you may consider us a contradiction to this saying."
Isam Rajab,"There's a general command of killing the children and enslaving the women, and that was when Musa (Moses) Peace be upon him infant, and that's why his mother placed him in a box in the sea.  Then there's a specific order for killing the children of those who are with him and enslaving the women. This pertains specifically to those who were with Musa (Moses) Peace be upon him at that time."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu'alaykum  1) Selling a car for naqd(up front lump) cash for $1000 but selling it in instalments for $2000 to the same person; is this what is classified as an shart within an shart that is not permissable? ; and does it come under Riba?. What is the ruling.  2) What is the state of a person in the grave. Is he alive or is he dead fully in the grave?  3) In the grave, is the punishment given on the physical body or on the soul or both. - Please provide references to Q's 2 and 3 if possible.  Jazakallaah Khayran"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I advise you to consult with a therapist. You already know that it's haram yet you couldn't help it and you did it so you don't really have a problem not knowing it's haram. Usually there's a problem and it's difficult to be solved without a therapy.  I'm able to tell you ask for Allah's forgiveness and inshallah Allah will help you and everything will be ok, but to be honest maybe this happens again and you don't want this to be repeated. Since this thing happened in the past, don't think about it. But if it happenes in the future then you may need a therapy."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You can say the Dua if you want but some scholars like Imam Ashafie Rahimahullah recommended saying this dua only after the second half of Ramadan.   Zakat is the obligatory money you have to pay for the money you saved after one year if it reached Nisab. But Sadaqah is not a specific amount nor it's mandatory. Sadaqah is optional and it doesn't have specific recipients like Zakat. Sometimes the term Sadaqah is used for Zakat in the Quran and the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam. But in general, Zakat is mandatory and Sadaqa is optional."
Isam Rajab,Please ask a specific quesiton since I can't extract a question from the falsehood I just read!
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Sharia doesn't stand for (Quran) only! Sharia includes many things in addition to the Quran.   Anyway, Allah says in Surat Al Baqarah {Allah made selling lawful and made usury unlawful}. So if you're purchasing shares from companies who deal with permissible business then it's allowed. But if you're purchasing shares from companies that deal with alcohol or selling pork or so then it's forbidden."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I don't need to read any article or go to any link to verify what Allah or his messenger say. I already have a link in the book of Allah says that the people of Lut were the first ones to do this major sin, so that means it's not a gene. This is a lie they want to sell and maybe some muslims are buying it. There are many people alhamdulillah repenting from this sin which also proves that it's not a gene. I totally disagree that people can't help it. They can if they wanted to. Allah will not hold you accountable for something you can't do!"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   You can leave your parts wet and also you can dry them. It's true that the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam mentioned the reward for performing wudu and it forgives the sins until the last drop.    But also it's in the authentic hadeeth in Al bukhari and others were Aisha used to bring the towel to the Messenger Sallallahu aliahi wasallam, if it's not allowed, she wouldn't do that."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   You can quote the Quran from memory if you memorize the Ayah. If not, then you can't quote it and say that's what Allah says in the Quran because Allah didn't say that. So yes you have to be accurate when you quote an Ayah from the book of Allah. In terms of hadith, many scholars permitted quoting the meaning of hadith becasue the hadith of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam is unlike the Ayat of Allah. The hadith of the Messenger is intended to be applied and followed while reciting the Quran is different. Still, some scholars said even the hadith should be quoted with the exact words."
Isam Rajab,"as-salam alykoom,  I hear some people saying 'ameen' when in salah but when the imam is reciting a surah other than al-Fatihah.  For example, I hear someone say 'ameen' after the last verse of surat al-Baqara.  Is this permissible?  Is there a difference if it is said out loud verses quietly to oneself?  Barak Allah feek."
Isam Rajab,"Every time that my husband and I go to my parent's house, he complains about me making minor mistakes. Does he even have the right to complain to my parents about nonsense things just to make me look bad and talk about what goes on in our household, while not mentioning anything about any problems to me? And while I do not talk about him or about what goes on in our household.What are some important issues that he can discuss with my parents?"
Isam Rajab,"It's unlikely possible, especially when you know that she's a pious, and Jinn have very limited effect on pious people.   A regular man could be possessed by jinn and then they can control his behavior even without him knowing it but I don't think this is what happened here since the guy has determined to do something to her. That's why I asked her to seek real help since it's a very important issue for her and it's very difficult for me to judge from my possition."
Isam Rajab,I have a huge sense of regret over a marriage proposal.  We came very very close to getting married but it didn't work out. Can you give me some advice because I am having a difficult time thinking of marrying anyone else. I still keep praying for Allah's help and make du'aa that things work out.  I am having a hard time forgetting and moving forward.
Isam Rajab,what is the diffrence?
Isam Rajab,"It's not bad to share your friend's feelings for graduation. It's something good to make them happy. It's not permissible if they're disobeying Allah or committing a sin during this party, so you should not attend. It's ok to congratulate them for their graduation. However, sometimes people imitate the disbelievers in every step in their graduation's party, so it becomes haram. But in general, this is something good to share your friend's happiness and congratulate them."
Isam Rajab,As salamu Alaikum I am a young sister whoi s trying to get married. My father is neither muslim nor is he living in the same stae as me. My mom is married so  my step-father became my walee. I've had a couple of sit downs and unfortunately im still not married. My step-father decided to step down from the position of being my walee because he felt that he was too judgemental and intimidating. So he decided to appoint someone else. Is it permissable for the brother that he appointed to be my walee?
Isam Rajab,There's an opinion that the Ka'ba was already built. It's built with the earth. There's another opinion that Adam built it also.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I agree with you, it's not wrong to ask a question to verify or to be sure.  Your question itself is not wrong but it's not the right place to ask it! This forum is not about people but about Halal and Haram."
Isam Rajab,no it's not true :D
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Unfortunately not! The ones I know they're qulaified don't like to do it."
Isam Rajab,"Sometimes, I totally forget to perform new wudhu for every salaah due to discharge, as I only recently became aware of its ruling. Does this mean that I have to repeat my Salaah?"
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu Alaikum  I was holding my daughter and her diaper leaked. I had the intention to wash the clothes and pray my isha. But after a while I had forgotten it since it dried up. So I ended up praying my isha and during fajr salaah I remembered what had happened. So shaykh, do I have to repeat those prayers?   JazakAllahu Khairn"
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum,  Once during the class you said that in order to be a scholar you have to know arabic. I just wanted to know that do we have to know arabic A to Z? If yes then what about those people who don't know arabic then they can't become a scholar?  Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   The Imam instructs people to straighten the lins and set the rows in order and to stand shoulder to shoulder but he doesn't say any specific dua."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You could pray witr according to the way you mentioned and that's the opinion of Imam Abi Hanifa Rahimahullah. But when you pray like that you need to remember that the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam himself never prayed it like that. He used to pray two raka'at and then after salam he prays one raka't. Or he used to pray 3 or 5 continues raka't but he doesn't sit for tashahud except in the last one.  So again you could pray 3 raka't with two tashahud but it was not done by the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam. Also the witr prayer is considered wajib in the hanafi school of thought because the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said : &quot;Allah has added one more salat so perform witr O people of Quran&quot;. But the majority of scholars said that witr is recommended and not wajib. Now whether it's an entire country or lots of countries it doesn't matter. We don't look at the number of people and judge according to that. The sunnah is sunnah whether few people did it or no one did it."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam alaikum  If a woman has some serious issues to deal with and Allaah knows her situation best, can she reject suitors until her situation improves?   Please understand, this is not just 揳nything?and if you were a sister I could tell you in details what the problems were and you would probably understand where I am coming from, but since you aren抰 and this is a public forum I will have to settle with 搒erious issues?  May Allaah reward you for your help"
Isam Rajab,"ASA I do not read arabic. As a result, i can not read the Qu'ran in arabic. I am told if i read only the translation during the month of Ramadan, i have not read the Qu'ran. Is that true. If this is true, i should not read the translation, just listen to a CD or tape.   Thank yoiu  Saeed Muhammad"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   That's true, smoking could indirectly effect your dua."
Isam Rajab,"salam  a sis asked me to ask this question.  he is a twin identical at that, she wears full niqab her sister dresses in basically nothing they look exactly alike, and everyone knows they were twins and identical from when they were children her twin sister at the age of 18 took off her hijab and started hanging out with the wrong crowd after her father died and the one in niqab on the other hand became stronger, she is very sad as everyone now knows what she looks like because of her sister, please advise."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said: &quot;The Imam is guarantor&quot; So he completes what the followers may have of shortcomings but that doesn't mean he's going to fill every single shortcoming or mistake such as someone who came and didn't perform wudu, he can't say the Imam will complete my salah. If the Imam made a mistake then it's upon himself only as the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said: &quot;There'll be Imams leading your prayers, if they did good then it's for them and for you, but if they made mistakes then it's against them and not against you&quot;.   The most qualified person to lead the prayer is the one who has most Quran and knolwedge. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said: &quot;The one who should lead the prayer is the one who has most (Memorization and knowledge) of Quran, but if they are equal in recitation then the one who has most knowledge of the Sunnah, but if they are equal then the one who performed Hijrah first, but if they are equal then the eldest amongst them)."
Isam Rajab,Asalamualaikum warahamtullahi wabrakatu   I read in an earlier question you were asked about whether if we can put our hair in a pony tail or not u said according to hadeeth your not to. So since the haddeth says u shudnt fold any limb while praying are we allowed to put our hair in a bun since that is also folding it??  Jazakahallah kairun
Isam Rajab,I can't say it's haram or halal but I prefer not to write this because it may involve ghibah and it could be also considered against the sunnah since the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam didn't criticize food.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh, May Allah shower you too and all muslims with blessings and grant you Jannah.   The one who's performing hajj doesn't have to pray Eid because he's busy with the rituals of hajj. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam didn't pray eid during hajj. Eid prayer is recommended sunnah anyways according to the majority of scholars."
Isam Rajab,"AssalamuALikum, I just came upon a work recently called Fiqh ul Muyassar by Fattah(i forgot full name). Do u recomend this work, because it seemed interesting although there was no tahqeeq in the book,i am basically looking for a work on the pattern of Ad dur al Bahiyya. Please let me know if i should purchase this.  Jazakallahu Khairan wa Jaza"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You don't have to be punished in order for your repentance to be accepted. The punishment is an expiation for the sin but Allah Subhanahu Wata'la is the Most Merciful and He may forgive us even without the punishment if we were sincere.   Regarding all the sins that you mentioned you need to stop doing them, this is the first step. Then if there's a right pertains to others you should give it back to them, like the money that was consumed, it should be paid back or you should ask them to forgive you. Erasing the trace of the sin is important. You were undutiful to your father or mother so pray for them and show gratitude to them, the same thing applies to the husband. Then ask Allah Subhanahu Wata'la for forgivenees after you have determined not to go back at all to any of those sins. With maintaining the prayer and other types of worship you'll be forgiven inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh,  A friend of mine wants to know if it is permissible to use lightly cream to even her skin tone because she has gotten dark marks around certian parts of her body during pregnancy."
Isam Rajab,"You need to work harder on your prayers. There's a Shaytan designated to stray people especially in their prayer. Before the prayer, try to perform Wudu perfectly, then give yourself sometime and remember that you're not standing before a great man or an important person, you're standing before Allah. This will help you inshallah remembering what you're doing in your prayer. Ask Allah subhanahuwata'al always to help you performing your prayer better and it'll happen inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"I don't mind her answering but then please move your questions to another section since I'm supposed to answer here and I assume that people expecting my answers.   I advise you to practice the Tajweed with a shaykh and I'm sure there are a lot inshallah where you live, Tajweed is not taken by books it's took by shaykhs so they could verify your recitation whether it's correct or not. Without a shaykh you'll never be able to perfect your recitation. That's what the entire Umma has been doing from the time of the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam until this very day.    In regards to your question, you should keep the lips rounded but you have to open them when you pronounce the Meem as it'll not appear if you keep them rounded and not change them."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum Sheikh.,  Is dating allowed in Islam?   For say, a brother ask for marriage and you don't know anything about him so you decide to go on a date with him just to know him and then if you think  he is a good person then you talk to your parents about him.   Jazak Allah  Asalam o alikum wr wb"
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu 'Alaykum shaykh  I have a personal question. Can a woman refuse her husband in bed if he comes to her at the wrong timing? For example, the husband harms his wife with his tongue, so she is upset, goes into the bedroom and starts crying. I mean, she is very hurt. But instead of the husband making up to her, he comes to her after 10 mins and wants to have intercourse. She is obviousliy not in the mood. But it feels a man would only do that to degrade her, as she cries during the intercourse and it does not bother him. He finishes and just walks away.   What do you advise the woman to do in such a case?"
Isam Rajab,"AOA  If a  man forces his wife to get an abortion (in first 3 weeks) and threatens her with divorce if she dosn't, and she gets the abortion who will bear the sin?"
Isam Rajab,"Scholars have specific names for the prayers after Isha, like Taraweeh pertains to the prayer in Ramadan. Yet, any prayer you pray after Isha is considered Qiamullail. Tahajjud is given to the prayer that's done after sleeping. But it's still from Qiamullail."
Isam Rajab,"Esselam Eleikum A woman wants to make hajj for her husband who passed away. They have a store but in that store they sell beer, pork, and other haram stuff. She is asking should she gather the money that they make from selling phone cards and make hajj for him or sell her gold and make hajj for him?  Jezak Allah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   There's a hadeeth narrated by Abu Dawood and others where the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam says :&quot;I don't allow it (The Masjid) for a woman in menses or a man who's Junub&quot;. Scholars talked about this hadeeth whether it's authentic or not, it's strong though but some scholars said that there's a difference between the woman in menses and the junub where the junub can purify himself by bathing but the woman can't until she finishes her period. So if a woman's period is 10 days then she has to stay for 10 days without entering a Masjid for learning! Therefore, I go with the opinion of allowing women to enter the Masjid especially in the west where they may not find any other opportunity to learn."
Isam Rajab,"Even here in USA we have locked and unlocked networks. they are usually not effected by having 1 or 2 more users. if it really slows down their speed then yes, you can't use it. Some network have 100 MBP, so it really doesn't matter. Yet, if it's small network and one more user will effect it, then you can't use it without their permission."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You need to remind her that these calamities befalling us is means of forgiveness for our sins. Whether we complained or not that won't change what Allah has decreed. Remind her of the vastness of the mercy of Allah Subhanahu Wata'la. Pray for her and that'll help inshallah. If you know some people who could talk to her, listening is helpful but not as one on one."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Well, if he's a traveller then he doesn't have to do Juma. If he's not and the time of Juma came yet where he's there's no Masjid then is his job the only option he has or not? Because you can't miss Juma if you're resident."
Isam Rajab,"can muslim parents beat their children, swear at them treat them diffrently not talk to them and make them do all the house work"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   There's a weak hadith about it and scholars differed whether you say it or not. So it's up to you if you apply the weak ahadith in the virtuous matters then do it if not then don't do it. I personally won't do it."
Isam Rajab,"There aer several opinions, the Majority says if it's less than 4 days then you can shorten the prayer, otherwise you have to pray the regular prayer.   Another opinion says as long as you're traveling then you can shorten the prayer since the term &quot;traveler applies to you&quot;   Imam Abu Hanifa says it's 14 days. There are other opinions as well in each school of thought."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You could ask a person on your behalf to go to him and see if he's interested so he could come and propose, there's nothing wrong with that.   You always need to ask Allah to choose for you."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   I never heard that monks wear this type of cloths, people in Morroco wear this type of cloths so it's incorrect that it's an imitation to the monks. It becomes forbidden if it's an explicit type of cloths that only this group on non muslims wear because once you wear it you'll be considered imitating them and this doesn't apply here."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahamtuallah,   If the conditions of marriage are fulfilled then it's permissible. The wife can give up some of her rights willingly. This is done by Sawda Radiallahu Anha the wife of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam when she gave up her night to Aisha Radiallahu Anha.   So in principle, this marriage is correct and permissible. Yet it should not be the common marriage and sometimes there are things permissible but they become prohibited because of the consequences they may have."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   No evidence compels women to cover their head while reciting the Quran or hearing the athan.   Shia's are many sects and divisions, some of them accuse the companions of apostasy and changing the Quran, others prefer Ali over Abu Bakr and Omar, others claim that Ali is a Messenger. So it depends on the group they follow.   Shia' don't have authentic sources like what we have. The make up hadeeth and say it's a tradition from the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam. If you study the science of Hadeeth then you'll be able to know exactly how's right and who's wrong."
Isam Rajab,Ya shayk  Is it true women who wear clothes that reveal the shape of the body are cursed? Also do you have any other examples of cursed women related to clothing and revealing the body?
Isam Rajab,"This could be a severe dry skin, I know many people who have dry skin and they never mentioned these severe symptomes. But if that's the case then you should see a doctor to have body lotion or other types to comfort your skin."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I believe I already answered this question earlier.   Every single actions is recorded. That's what the Quran says clearly.   18:49 {And they will say: Ah! woe to us! what a book is this! it does not omit a small one nor a great one, but numbers them (all)}."
Isam Rajab,"assalamu alaikum, Is it permissible to eat food in nonmuslim restaurants ie things like bread, cooked vegetables, fish, etc. I am asking with reference to the fact that many normal items (like the above) may have questionable ingredients (like enzymes or flavors from animals or alcohol). if one questions the waiter/chef, they wouldn't know about these things. Am I going too far into details?  Similarly, must we call and enquire about all product ingredients when we buy things (like bread, juice) from the grocery stores here?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   This is almost the 5th or 6th time I answer the same question. If you go to work then you're not a traveler. Do you take luggage with you? do you intend to travel or work? That's what I believe.  There's another opinion though says that you're allowed to shorten and combine the prayers as long as you're going more than 48 miles regardless of your intention."
Isam Rajab,can we keep this name Maliaka or maliakah for a child? If not could you answer with proofs from Quran or sunnah so that we could pass on to our dear sister who is thinking of keeping this name for her child.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's ture. You don't have to see anything. Once you Ask Allah to choose for you He'll then choose for you but I can't say if you did see something in your dream then it's nothing.  I believe it's a sign just as if you wanted the other choice but once you go there something stops you then it's also a sign."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's not permissible to use Music as a cure. The Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam was asked about alcohol if it's ok to use it as a cure, but he said it's a disease, he said that Allah didn't make the unlawful things as cure, so this icludes music.   Allah says in the Quran that the Quran is a cure, so you want us to say No Quran is not cure and music is cure?"
Isam Rajab,"Esselam Eleykum, Sheikh I wanted to ask what shoul you do with the papers or notebooks that have Allah's name on them? For example I know we should burn them, but my parents don't allow me they think I'll burn the house or something. So can I scrible over Allah's name or rip them into tiny pieces? Jazakum Allah Khayr."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Abu Ilyaas.    I actually went to the hadeeth in Sunan Abi Dawood again and the interpretation says Because they see (what's coming from the sky) that which you don't see.  So Allah knows best if that also includes dogs. I didn't hear it or read it from any scholar, but if someone thought that it saw a shaytan there's a possiblity that it's right based on the hadeeth.   I'm still working on the Isnad to see why Ashaykh Al Albani Rahimahullah gave it Sahih category since it's from the narration of Ibn Ishaq who does concealment in the hadeeth."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's the same bath. But after menses the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam commanded women to clean themselves by following the trace of the blood. But this is something before the bath itself.   There are two methods of performing Ghusl. One is according to the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam where you clean your genitals and then you perform wudu then you start with your right side and then your left side and then your hair. And there's another method which is sufficient but not perfect when you run the water over your entire body. There are lots of ahadith in both al Bukhari and Muslim and other books about the description of Ghusl and I recoomend you going directly to thses sources to read how the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam did it exactly."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   Your left hand should be opened but your right hand should be a fist except for the middle fingerand the thumb where you make a circle and the index where you should keep moving it during the entire tashahud"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   You can accept it if they're paying for it."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Your duty is to enjoin the good and forbid the evil. If that'll happen once you tell her parents then you should tell them. If that'll cause her to indulge more in sins then you should not tell them. I think you should first adivse her and then threaten her instead of going and telling her parents right away unless you know that they'll be able to stop her. One of the conditions of forbidding the evil is not to generate a greater evil."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If you ask about supporting the group who believe that it's the goddess then of course not you can't support it. But if you ask about the company that manufactures the sports gears and sneakers then I don't see a problem with it unless people have the notion that it's the goddess!  At any rate, changing the name is better to avoid this confusion and purchasing from a different store is better but for a person who's purchasing athlete clothes I can't tell him don't buy it because of the name."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   No it's not mandatory. Umar Radiallahu Anh recited with sajdah but didn't perform sujud. That's the opinion of the vast majority of scholars. If you're memorizing you don't have to repeat it every time because it's a sajdah for recitation not for memorization, so you can make sujud the first time."
Isam Rajab,Saalam...  i'm a sista who Alhamduliallahi don't wear pants outside...but i have this Q...??? i was at a halaqah and i heard that a women can't wear pants infront of her hasband and others sisters in Islam...it this true..plzzz provide with examples  jazzakumallahu khair!
Isam Rajab,"as-salamu alaykum ya shaykh,   i know that Rasulullah ordered that the the 2-rakat tahiyyatul masjid prayer be done even when a man comes in late for jumuah, ie during the khutbah, and briskly if so.  Normally I arrive before the adhan, do the tahiyyat, sit down. During adhan I repeat what the muadhdhin is saying, and make the dua for after the adhan. Then quietly listen to khutbah.  Today I came in late after the imam had ascended and given salam to the jamah, and during the adhan that followed that I found a space.   Now I was confused - should I remain standing and do my usual for the adhan, and then do my tahiyyat as the khutbah is starting.. or should I do tahiyyat straight away and miss the adhan benefits, but I am ready and attentive for the khutbah.. which would you advise in this situation ya shaykh?  secondly, o shaykh, as I found a lack ability to weigh the merits and priorities and huqooq of the situation.. if you can help me to learn from you from this example, some principles in how to weigh between the recommended actions then please shaykh, barakallah feekum, it would help my fiqh fiddeen..  wassalam"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahamtullahi Wabarkatuh,   Yes she'll be rewarded inshallah. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam says &quot;The reward for an action is by its intention&quot; so if your intention is to worship Allah you'll get the reward for it. Menstruation doesn't prevent you from Dua so you could make dua and ask for forgiveness and you could still read quran without touching the Quran, so you can do lots of things."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It depends on the area, the knowledge and other factors. I can't give specific age. In general it's recommended to marry early as long as you have the means to do so."
Isam Rajab,"If this person is really affected with Sihr then he can't read Quran properly so technically he won't be able to study Quran unless the Sihr is removed so that's not an option.   He can eat 7 dates every day first thing in the morning and that'll protect him from sihr as the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said. (I already monetioned that in a previous answer). Also he has to pray to Allah Subhanahu Wata'la especially in the last third of the night to help him with this matter. Also, Zamzam water could be helpful since the Messenger Sallallahulaihi wasallam mentioned that it's a cure from diseases."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   The Majority of scholars allowed the husband more than taking what he already paid to his wife. Some said it's allowed but makrooh and others said it's not makrooh. There's no Ijmaa' in this issue. Of course you'll not come across this in Tafsir Ibn Kathir because it's not a source of Fiqh."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamou alaykom warahmatullahe wabarakataho,  I saw the answer to the post titled, 揇o I have to make up this salah??I never knew that the sojoud is a pillar of the salaah, and sometimes I forget to make 2 and I have to make the sojoud as-sawh. I hate making this sojoud as-sawh, but sometimes I get very involved in the duaa that I make during the first sojoud, that I forget whether or not I am in my first or second sajdah! This means that, may Allah forgive me, I have had to make the sojoud as-sawh on a regular basis because of not being sure how many sojoud I have made.  So when I saw the answer to that question, I realized that I have been wrong in this all of my life... I have no idea how many prayers I have done this for, so I have no idea how many salah I need to make up! Is there a shaytan that comes just for the salah? Because I truly try hard to concentrate, but most of the time the reason I forget which sojoud I am on honestly because I am making du-ah! And I hate that this happens very much.  Knowing that I have made this crucial mistake in so many salah, and I have no idea what the amount is, where should I go from here?  May Allah reward you. Please make du-ah for my forgiveness and guidance and khoshoo and ikhlas in salah!"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes, in all cases you mentioned they're maharam. Because if for any reason your sister is divorced, he can't marry her grandmother.   The same thing applies to you. Your grandfather can't marry your wife if you divorced her."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu Alaykum Warahmatullahi Waberekatuhu Must one say &quot;Bismillahirahmaniraheem&quot; before reciting ayat-ul-kursi, because I heard you can't recite it after saying &quot;A3uthubillahiminashaytanirajeem&quot; so do we have to basmil? May Allah reward you for your effort to answer our questions."
Isam Rajab,"Yes, but again in principle a man is allowed to sell what he owns the way he wants and the price he likes. You need a very strong reason to control or limit this right."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Yes it's true, it's the sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualihai wasallam to lie down before the obligatory subh prayer, maybe the reason behind that is he used to pray most of the night so he rests for few minutes before the Subh prayer. I don't know specific reward for doing this except that you're following the Sunnah."
Isam Rajab,If he said it without &quot;will&quot; then she's divorced once she does it and his negligence is irrelevant. But if he said I will then it's indirect and once it happens he'll be aksed if she's divorced or not.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Yes I don't see anything wrong since they can remarry anyone they want so why don't they remarry? Even if they were still Kuffar they can remarry. I'm not really sure if that's your question. According to what I understood it's permissible there's nothing wrong with it."
Isam Rajab,"Aslam U alikum  if i finished guhsl and found out that i missed one of the body part where water might have not reached , do i have to do guhsl again ? like if i remember just before leaving washroom but after finishing ghusl , i have urinated and changed my intention to clean minor impurity. And then i went back to clean that body part? is my guhsl valid? or i have to do ghusl again?"
Isam Rajab,Islam guided us if we love someone to go and propose not to look for answers through dreams!! That's what we learn from the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam. Istikharah comes next. But no one does istikharah whether to pray or not!    Yes you've gotten so deep into those dreams that almost the devil is playing with you as he wants and letting you rely on dreams instead of being realistic. How do you know that you saw the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam? Most likely you didn't see him.   I advise you to forget everything about this guy and ask Allah Subhanahu Wata'la for forgiveness. If he wanted you then he should've come forward and talked to your family instead of letting you dream for 4 years.
Isam Rajab,No it doesn't. The only shot that may nullify your fast is the nutritional shot.
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh,   Someone said the following hadeeth is weak:   Abu Dawood narrates that Aishah (raa) said: &quot; Asma'a the daughter of Abu Bakr (raa) came to see the Messenger of Allah (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) wearing a thin dress; so Allah's Messenger (Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam) turned away from her and said: &quot;0 Asma'a, once a woman reaches the age of puberty, no part of her body should be seen but this -and he pointed to his face and hands.&quot;     Is this true?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, In gold, we don't look at the value but look at the weight. So if it's over 85 grams of pure gold then you should pay the Zakaht. If not then you don't have to pay anything."
Isam Rajab,What is permissible for Muslims during a wedding ceremony. Does a Muslim need a wedding. How should the wedding be in accordance with Islam?
Isam Rajab,"asalaamalykoom wa rahmatullah,  JazakumAllah khair for your time shaykh.  I am planning on learning game/graphic/animation design so that I can start creating Islamic computer games/movies/documentaries etc.  To do this, I would need to design graphical representations of humans and animals, but ofcourse not of any prophet, sahabi or angel.  Is this the same as drawing pictures?  Is there anything that forbids such a thing?  Thank you for your time, may Allah reward you"
Isam Rajab,"Sh. Isam, As salamu alaykum  What do you suggest a person do if they were invited to speak on a panel with someone who is not upon the proper aqeedah?  What is your advice on how to interact with panelists who are calling people to deviant methodoligies?  shukran."
Isam Rajab,"This is a general Question so I'll answer in General:   Sujud has to be on 7 parts: the two hands, the forehead and the nose, the two knees and the two feet. It has to be facing the Qibla. You have to have Wudu. You have to cover yourself (Awra) If this prostration is to thank Allah Subhanahuwata'la then some scholars said it doesn't have to be facing the Qibla and you don't have to have Wudu also."
Isam Rajab,"The answer is one, you want to read surat Annas so you read it at the end. You want to read something else so you start with it and you delay surat Annas to the second Raka'h."
Isam Rajab,"we have in Islam specific punishments &quot;hudud&quot; and we have general punishments &quot;Ta'zir&quot; determined by the judge. we have the punihsment of committing adultry and we have the punishment for drinking alcohol.. etc. in the child abuse case, in addition to the punishement, the judge may increase it according to what he see is the justise. but again, this is the job of the judge, unfortunately, some excited brothers want sometimes to enfource these rulings by themselves, which is wrong!"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If I say i'ts not ok that means she's goning to endanger her life! So if that's the case then it's permissible to have a male doctor. Otherwise, it's not permissible. The sister should ask first before she's in labor about her delivery. She has 9 months to choose a good place where there'll be a female doctor."
Isam Rajab,"In light of the increasing expenses of living in the UK, in particular for essentials such as a house, sending children to Muslim schools, preparations for hijra (migration) and so on, would it be considered irresponsible for young men who do not have high earnings or are not on a clear career path for high earnings to marry?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I didn't get your question very well but according to what I understood yes it's permissible for Muslims to destroy historic places for valid reasons and it's already done in the Prophetic Masjid in Madinah were many historical sites are removed to expand the Masjid. If they wanted to keep these historic sites, Muslims would never be able to pray together in the Masjid.  The same thing is true about the house of Allah Subhanahu Wata'la in Mecca."
Isam Rajab,My Christian sister is getting married and I will be attending - I would like to know the proper adaab of a Muslim while in a church witnessing the matrimonial ritual.  Jazak Allahu Khairan.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   I don't know which dua you're talking about, if it's the dua of the Istikhara itself then you can say it before the end of the prayer or right after it.   So if you say it after the prayer then you don't have to have wudu since you're done with your prayer but I can't imagine someone just said the salam and he lost his wudu right after that!"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   No, you'll be rewarded for what you did not what the cassette did. Our reward is based on our intentions as the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said and the tape has no intention."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamualikum,  If I wish to fast on Mondays, Thursday or any other day except during Ramadhan what is the niyah I recite to open and close the fast?  Is it different from the niyah in Ramadhan?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, I suggest you go the one who gave you the fatwa and ask him about this hadith."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I wish you the best inshallah and I ask Allah to purify your intention. Seeking knowledge is one of the best acts of worship that could bring you close to Allah Subhanahu Wata'la, but before you seek knowledge you have to ask yourself why you're doing this? Is it to become famous at have everyone knows you? That's not a good intention. Remember that the first people who'll be punished in hellfire before the disbelievers will be a man who learnt the knowledge but not for the sake of Allah.   Aisha Radiallahu Anha didn't expose herself to men as she was a wife of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam and it's forbidden for her to let the men see her so you can't take this as an evidence.   Again you should ask yourself why you're seeking knowledge? Your intention first should be to remove ignorance and you shouldn't care whether people gave you credit or not as Imam Ashafie Rahimahullah said.   I wish you the best inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   First: I don't know where did you get the definition of Zina from? Because it's totally wrong. You don't have to be married to commit zina and you can have sexual intercouse out of wedlock while it's not considered zina.   Second: Zina and Rape are two different things. in Zina both individuals are punished but that's not the case with rape.  It's up to the judge to add any suitable punishment for the rapist, it could reach death if the judge believes he deserves to be killed or it could be less."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikumassalam,   Yes a person can pray as usual without shortening the prayer but it's not recommended. Before we ask about the purpose we have to know that the prophet sallallahualiahi wasallam did it and all scholars agreed that it's the sunnah. Shortening the prayer while traveling is a permission from Allah to make the prayer easy for muslims as they might be busy while traveling."
Isam Rajab,"assalaamu alaikum shaikh  I have a problem regarding my niyyah, specifically when I read the Quran.  Whenever I read or memorize, I imagine myself leading others in prayer and impressing people, instead of thinking about the meaning of the ayaat I read.  Also, I never cry when I read or listen to Quran.  Can you advise me how I can remove this nifaaq from my heart and correct my niyyah?  Also, how can I make my heart soft?  Baarak Allaahu feek  wasalaamu alaikum wa rahmatallaah"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The wife always has iddah, if the husband doesn't return to Islam during the iddah then she can marry someone else after her iddah is over.   He doesn't have the right of custody, because he's already supposed to be killed according the Islamic Law if he became Muslim and he changed his religion."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, It's permissible to have someone sacrifcing on your behalf. She pays the money so she makes sure that her sacrifice is accepted by choosing a healthy goat over the minimum age which is one year for the goat and 6 months for the sheep. If she doesn't have money then she doesn't have to sacrifice!  If that money is her son's and he allowed her to take it then she can use it for the sacrifice. Otherwise, she should not."
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu alaykum  揂nd when you ask the ladies for anything, ask them from before a screen. That makes for greater purity for your hearts and for theirs.?  Is this ayah referring to umm-al-mu'minoon or all female believers and what is meant by 'behind a screen'?"
Isam Rajab,Asalamu alaykum  is it permissible for a husband to deny divorce to his wife who is serious about it and truly feels she has to be away from this man?
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu alaikum Sheikh,  Are there any specific duas from the Qur'an or Sunnah that a sister can recite towards the end of her pregnancy, and especially during labor (so that the delivery may go smoothly and/or for the child itself)?  If so, can you please give the evidence from the qur'an or sunnah for it?  Jazakallah khair and thank you in advance."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   In Islam we follow the lunar calendar and the crescent is a sign for it."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum,   I know its wrong to draw living things. But my younger brother, who is 16 yrs old, had a school project due, in which he had to draw Julius Caeser pictures. He don't know how to draw, so he asked me because of my good drawing.  1st I refused to make pictures of a human being, but then my mom said that its okay to make it because its for your school its not that you just drawing it for fun. And my brother said that if he will not do this project, he will get an &quot;F&quot; in that class. I was helpless, I had to make it. So, before start drawing the human being pictures, I asked Allah for forgiveness.  And I still feel bad about drawing those picutres.   My question is that is it okay to draw living things for your school project? If not, then what should one do when he/she has to do those kind of projects?  Jazak Allah Khair  Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,The people of Jannah will get whatever they wish. So if a sister wishes a husband in Jannah then she'll be answered.
Isam Rajab,"bismillahir Rahman ar-Rahim  assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh  I need your advice about my situation. I am here with my husband and we have no papers. alhamdulellah he can take care of me and my child, but he also has to pay for his children in his homecountry and he wants to save for the future. Now he wants me to go to his homecountry where i have no mahram, i dont speak the language and no experience how to live with my child. the benefit is that it is an islamic country and the living expenses will be less.My husband will not be able to come and visit for at least another year, maybe even three years.   I could also stay here and work. i might even be able to get the papers due to my profession, but i will have to take off the niqab and leave my child in the day care and getting the papers will require a reasonable amount of money. on the other hand, i might not be able to find a job without papers.   Or, i go to my country (not an islamic country) where i dont know any muslim (yet) and where my non-muslim family will try to turn me away from islam. i will also have to work there, probably without niqab, but at least i have a workpermit, which makes finding a job easier. Please advice what is the best situation according to islam. jazakkallah khairan."
Isam Rajab,Please kindly rewrite your question in 1 or 2 sentences so I could answer it clearly.
Isam Rajab,can one see Kaba while doing Tawaf?
Isam Rajab,"Dear Sir,  There is a question that creat alot of doubt in my mind. Alhamdoliilah I am a muslim but if I was not born in a muslim family there is 99% chance that I would not be a muslim. So the question is that why non-muslims will go the hell when they have no control over their birth in a Muslim Family. Even if some one is born in a shia family or sunni family there is a big chance that he will remain that so how would we expect the non-mulims to accept Islam."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It came in the hadeeth of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam that he gave permisison for the resident to wipe over his foot covering for a day and a night i.e 24 hours.   So scholars differed whether this time starts from the time you put on your foot covering or from the time you lose your Wudu or from the time you start wiping over them, so there are three opinions in this matter.   So if someone puts his foot covering after performing Wudu at 7 AM yet he loses his Wudu at 10:30 AM yet he doesn't wipe over them until 12:30 Pm then there are three opinions on when he should remove his foot covering. The last two opinions are stronger than the first one and I choose the average which is the opinion of Imam Ashafie Rahimahullah. So in that case he has to remove it by 10:30 AM. So according to this opinion if he prayed Thuhr @ 12 Pm without taking off the foot covering and performing wudu then he has to re pray. But according to the last opinion (which is also strong) he doesn't have to do anything.   Remember though that this is only a &quot;permission&quot; and some people take this as a habit and they wipe over their foot covering 5 days a week which is not sunnah!"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Allah Subhanahu Wata'la forgives all sins including shirk if the person who committed them turned to Allah in repentance. So if you repented from any sin it's forgiven.   Otherwise, there's no use for calling non muslims to Islam if their sins won't be forgiven!   Without repentance, Shirk is not forgiven, but anything else could be forgiven or could not be forgiven.  This is the correct understanding of the Ayat of the Book of Allah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If your intention is ok then it should be fine as long as it's not used by others with other meanings or notions. If that's the case then you can't use them even if your intention is ok."
Isam Rajab,"Sisters also have the same rulings, it's mutual. If a sister fears falling into Haram, then Marriage becomes wajib. But in general, Marraige is recommended for both genders."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   If these cartoons are not of the types which have lives then it's permissible.  The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam mentioned the reason of forbidding drawings of living creatures which is rivaling Allah's creation."
Isam Rajab,"I have a question, i wanted to memorize quran or atleast 10 juz. is it possible to do using tapes and listening to good reciter and then try to repeat like them or you would say it is necessary to have a teacher for memorizing. can you also please give some tips for memorizing the quran Jazakallah kher"
Isam Rajab,"I am making istikharaah whether to consider a brother in regards to marrying him. There has been no proposal. After reading the du'aa, I get the inclination to do nothing and to consider someone else. I also feel like if I proceed, I am putting myself in a situation where I will be tested (not be happy). My family agrees that we are not compatibe but wants me to overlook and overcome this and consider marrying him because I am getting older. The brother is a practicing Muslim and he has also expressed his concerns to me over our incompatiblity. Please advise me. I want to do the right thing but at the same time do not want to put myself in a situation where I will be tested."
Isam Rajab,"Sheikh, Do you have to wear new clothing for Eid?"
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu Alaikum wr wb  I want to ask, if a sister is walking alone,  and there may be danger imposed on her, since she is walking in a quiet street. If a brother by chance asks her if he can give her a ride to her house, because it is not safe for her, would it be alright if she accepts it?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   If the husband and the parents agree on things then they have to keep their words. If the husband wants his wife not to continue her studies then she has to agree on that as well. These things should be made clear before the contract."
Isam Rajab,"Assalaam Alaikum dear shaykh,  I have heard two differing opinions about homosexuals that claim to be muslim:  1. some say that that they are muslim but committing a major sin (just a muslim committing zinah or something) or 2. some say they are just completely kafir  Can you please give insight into this? I know in a previous post u spoke of it being against nature... so does that constitute them falling out of the realm of islam?  Jazakum Allahu Khairan!!"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You just didn't say a good word that's all which is not a sin. Asking for Forgiveness is recommended always whether you committed a sin or not. You didn't intend to disrespect the scholar nor the fiqh itself so it's not a sin. Some books indeed have cramming but that's not to anyone to say unless he's a scholar and he knows what he's talking about."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Yes it seems that there's no punishment but there definately is! The one who's able to resurrect the ashes is able to punish the soul and the body whether we knew how or we didn't know how this is happening."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikumassalam,   There are many gyms where they have isolated places for ladies only. So you can go there."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The Masjid of the Prophet Sallallahualiahi wasallam didn't have rugs or carpet. That's why whenever it rained it used to be little bit muddy. But when he visited Anas's house and prayed there he prayed on &quot;starw mat&quot;. Yes you can still pray in that room."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikumassalam,   Yes it's true."
Isam Rajab,"Assalaamu alaikum,  Regarding a baby that miscarried at approximately 6-8 weeks : Does the hadith of a miscarried child pulling his parents into jannah apply to a baby at this stage?  And the hadith about the children who have died young being with ibrahim in Paradise, does this also apply?  Please be kind enough to give me any information relating to miscarriage in Islam.  I would really appreciate it.  I am finding very little material on this.  JazakAllaahu khairan.  Wassalaamu alaikum,"
Isam Rajab,"Whenever an enemy attacks a muslim country and the muslims in that country can't defend themselves then it becomes obligatory upon all muslims around the world to help them.   If Jihad becomes 'Fard Ayn&quot; yet your parents need help then you start with your parents, that's the understanding from the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualihai wasallam when a man came to him telling him that he left his parents so the Messenger Sallallahualihai wasallam asked him to go back.   Limiting Jihad to fighting only is a very narrow understanding since you could help with your money and other ways as well.   The issue is a bit lengthy and it requires further details."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahamatullahi Wabarakatuh,   If there was an agreemen to live for 1 year in her parent's house then how could he ask her to sleep with him?  I already said and I'm saying again in this matter they should all agree on these things. If the husband insists then the wife has to choose between her parents and him. She can obey him but he may divorce her after that and then she may lose her parents and her husband as well."
Isam Rajab,"The first hadeeth in Sahih Muslim, the Second Hadeeth in Sunan Abi Dawood and others, It's authentic though."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   No it's not fard, all scholars agreed that it's not fard."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   According to what you mentioned it's not permissible. Scholars gave permission for such traveling when it's for a religious cause like Hajj but not wedding! This distance requires Mahram."
Isam Rajab,Salam  1 - How can on thank Allah Taala?  2 - How did the Prophet [pbuh] started his duas?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   This is a good way of Dawah, and I do think it's a good idea. Since it's the MSA and most of the audience in twenties maybe the comparison between Islam and the moderen society in respecting the human is a good topic, or the justice in Islam, or the best of course is the oneness of Allah and our servitude to Him, How Islam freed the man. There are really many topics could be talked about in Khutba."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   In every group you need a person in charge. whether it's small or big, in school you need a principal, in a country you need a presidant, in a house you need a person in charge. If you give this right to 2 people then it'll never be stable as each one could end it anytime they want.   The husband is given this right because he's the one who proposed and he's the one who's spending on the household so most likely he won't mess with it, and even if he did the wife still has rights if there're children and she still has the Mahr if she didn't take it in advance."
Isam Rajab,It's allowed for men and women to dye their hair but they should avoid the black color.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes it is. Unless there's an excuse of course. Scholars differenciate though between what could be separated from the body and what could not, in your case, you could move the hat little bit above so you should let the skin touches the ground."
Isam Rajab,AssalamoAlaikum  what are the rules to making istinja? I heard if you pass out gas you don't need to make istinjaa you just start from your hands. When are we supposed to make istinjaa?
Isam Rajab,"Usually business owners increase the price when you pay later, the more you dely the more money they'll ask. However, when you and the seller agree on a period of time for payment. It doesn't matter how they calculated the increment of the price. If you already agreed on a price to be paid within 4 years then it's permissible. But once you both agree on a price, he can't come later and charge you extra money based on late payments. That's the difference between increment based on type of sale and increment based on time. I believe it was very clear but I'm trying to make it clearer here."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes of course you can make Dua in Sujud in Fard prayer, that's the best place and time where you can make dua. and you can make it in your own language but it's preffered to be in Arabic."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, If a man divorces his wife while she's pregnant then he's not iallowed n the delivery room and he can't watch the baby coming out! She becomes stranger once she delivers the baby. He could wait outside. The father and other Mahrams can be in the delivery room as long as they don't look at the Awra of the woman."
Isam Rajab,is it ok to play with fire?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The water that is meant here in this ayah of the creation of human beings is &quot;semen&quot;. This is very obvious for anyone who studied Tafsir. This word &quot;water&quot; is also used by the Messenger Sallallahualaihi Wasallam when he was asked about performing ghusl with water and he said if you see the water which is &quot;semen&quot;."
Isam Rajab,"Asslamu Alaikum, i heard that its disliked to peirce your nose, then i heard its haraam, and its sunnah. Now im lost! My two older sisters and my mom did it in Pakistan. But i asked a sheikh, he said you can do it if its in culture. Then i asked him even if its against your religion. I was afraid he had given me false facts. My mom want me to pierce my nose, but i wasnt sure becase she is not that religious. i wouldnt want to pierce my nose, even for my wedding, if it displeases my lord. I told her this, and she said the other sheikh said you can if its your culture. What should i do? Can i pierce my nose or just wear a fake one or something?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, She has to see how much does show owe for the previous years of Zakat and she has to pay it because it's the debt of Allah Subhanahu Wata'la."
Isam Rajab,"Shaykh My mother has a bad temper and if I do a silly mistake she makes duaa against me, and she does not treat me and my brothers equally if my brothers do something bad and I mean really bad they(my mother and father) just yell at them but she doesn't make duaas against them, but meanwhile because I'm a girl she tells me May Allah curse you, May Allah take you sometimes even May the jinn take you, she's rough on me, and compared to all my friends in school, I do the most for my mother, my friends don't even know how to cook and all they do is sit and study. What is really bothering me is the way she treats me, and the way she treats my brothers it's unfair. What should I do? I be nice to her but it doesn't work."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu alaikum, I heard a lecture in which it was said that a woman had come to Umar (RA) asking for divorce from her husband. When her husband came, he said he had (due to age) decreased in sexual energy. When Umar (RA) heard this, he rebuked her (for asking for divorce).  I thought it was permissible for a woman to ask for divorce if her husband can no longer satisfy her. Unlike a man, a woman doesn't have the option of taking a younger second spouse or sleeping with a slave, so it seems that divorce is her only option to be satisfied (so later, she may remarry). I know most women would NOT want to leave their husband even if he became impotent or had a low level of desire after many years of marriage, but I want to know, from a technical standpoint, is it sinful to ask for divorce? I realize that there are severe consequences in the the hereafter for asking for divorce for no reason. Jazakallah khair."
Isam Rajab,Asalmu Alaykum My question is did the Greek philosophy harm Islam in any way? If so can you please explain how by jotting some examples. Jezakum Allah Kheir.
Isam Rajab,"If there's a muslim judge she goes there and he'll be able to establish the divorce for her after investigating what happened exactly.  If there's no muslim judge then she has to go to the Islamic Center where they could check on her case and then decide.   This issue depends on how he left and where did he go, is it a traveling that's safe or he might be dead. There are lots of things involoved in it and only the judge or a person of Islamic authority should decide."
Isam Rajab,As-salamu 'alaikum sheikh Isam  my Q is ... is there specific duaa to say when making a prostration due to hearing it when the shiekh/someone recites it from the ayaat in the Quran?  i hope this is clear!  jazzaka allahu khair
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Thanking Allah Subhanahu Wata'la is part of the Tawbah when you acknolwedge that He's the One who blessed you with everything so you should not disobey Him. That's part of the tawbah. If you can't concentrate on one thing then try to concentrate on one thing. Ask yourself what's distracting you? Keep going back to the thing you're thinking of. Maybe you'll be distracted once or twice but then definately you'll be able to focus on that thing."
Isam Rajab,If no one performed the funeral prayer while he's a Muslim then it has to be performed. If you know some brothers who knew him you could gather and pray the funeral in Jama'h.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   You don't have to say Dua in Arabic in the prayer. You could say it in your language. You could also say the dua after you finish your prayer.  You know better what do you want from Allah Subhanahu Wata'la so you should be able to ask Him whatever you want. If you don't know any specific Dua, you could read the duas from the Quran, the last ayat of Surat Al Baqara. The Dua of Ibrahim Peace be upon him in Surat Ibrahim. There are many duas in the Quran that you could say inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Katm is a type of dark coloring they used to dye their hair with.   The hadeeth doesn't say &quot;You only can dye when the hair is gray&quot; so you can change the coloring as long as you avoid the black color."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The picture which is forbidden is the (Drawing). At the time of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam they didn't have Camers. That's why it's disliked and not haram. This is according to one opinion. There are some scholars who said it's totally haram and you can follow them if you want."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, If your job doesn't involove any prohibited transaction then it's permissible."
Isam Rajab,"Assalaamu aleykum.  Dear Shaykh I would apreciate if you would like to answer my question.  When I saw some kaafir cartoons intended to mock the Muslim reactions on the cartoons of the Prophet (sall'Allaahu aleyhi wa sallam) (may Allaah (swt) curse the Danish drawers), I happened to laugh because the picture looked funny. Then after I deeply regretted it and thought it could be kufr because it is kufr akbar to mock Islam. I decided to try to avoid such pictures in the future.  Now my question is if it becomes kufr akbar if one laughs at something like the example above, i.e by mistake and not intentionally? And note that the laughing was at the picture with its weird figures, not at Islam. So the &quot;intention&quot; (it is hard to form any intention when one laughs unwillingly) was not to laugh at Islam but at the picture.  I know actions are judged by intentions, but from what I've seen the rulings seems to be stricter when it comes to blasphemy and kufr issues.  Barak Allaah feek."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's always recommended to recite the Qura'n and say the athkar whether there was magic or not.  One of the solutions scholars mentioned is to recite some of the Ayat of the quran especially Surat Al Fatiha on water and sprinkle it on the walls of the business. Anyone can read the athkar but it's always better for the person who runs or owns the business to do it for himself. I already answered about 2 questions regarding this topic."
Isam Rajab,"Deobandies have some innovations in Aqeeda, Islamic Creed. This is in general, it might vary when it comes to the personnel. They have some innovations in the attributes of Allah, they follow extreme sufies in some issues. Yet they are still Muslims since they testify that Allah is one and Muhammad is his messenger and they pray the same prayers we pray."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I don't have a good answer actually! This is the first time I think about it this way. However, the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said that when people will know the Mahdi that he's the Mahdi will give a pledge so it's possible that all muslims at the time will be with Al Mahdi wherever he is. The other hadith that will help in this matter is the hadith in which the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam mentioned that 70 thousand of the children of Ishaq will conquer a city half of it on the sea and half of it on the land.   I'll give it a second thought inshallah soon. But remember that it's always difficult to apply the Prophetic traditions on current situations."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's better to pray two and then another two. Because in the hadith where the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said that whoever prayed twelve Raka't Allah will build for him a house in paradise it's mentioned that he prayes 2 before thuhr, so you pray two before thuhr and that's the usual sunnah but you could add two so you pray four in total. That's what you're supposed to do in general, you pray two and then two. Even if you miss the sunnah, you could still make it up after the fard because the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam did it when Um Salamah Radiallahu Anha reminded him and he also told the people that whoever missed his portion of Qiamullail he chould make it up after sunrise."
Isam Rajab,"salaamu`alaykum  I was out to eat with some brothers... anyhow... A brother was trying to pay for my food and I really didn't want him to... I was very sick of brothers paying for me each time and not letting me pay... Anyhow... I got angry to the point where I said, &quot; I swear by Allaah I will pay for my meal &quot; - and the brother said okay etc, so he was at the register/etc and said you can go after me, so when I went up to pay, the lady said he had already paid for me..  Do I have to offer any form of expiation since I swore by Allah or just make tawbah for swearing by Allah for a stupid matter like this?  sorry I know it's a stupid question : ("
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   It's in the book of Athan chapter: Sujud on 7 parts &quot;bones&quot;. It's also in Saheeh Muslim book of prayer chapter: parts of prostration."
Isam Rajab,"Assalaam ulaikum. I have a very important question for me and many other women in my community. Please answer as soon as possible we are waiting anxiously. We have set up for the past few years dhikr session where a senior muslim lady does tafseer of the Holy Quran and goes over Hadiths with us. She had started but not completed an Alim course years ago. First of all I would like to say that she is a most dear and pious woman, and tries to be the best Muslim possible. We respect her a lot.   However recently we have begun to become confused,  And there are even some issues in which mostly every scholar agrees with, She only believes in what she has learned from her madrassah everything else to her is haram.  I will give you examples:  She says it is haram to combine Zuhr and Asr in time of need.  She says it is haram to dye your hair, She says it is haram for a woman to lead women in namaz.  When she is confronted with hadith she says that she has never heard of that hadith impying because she has not heard of it, she does not believe it.   This all is leading towards much bickering and arguments and bad feeelings.   Our question is should we continue to attend the sessions with this dear lady or should we refrain.   Also should the parts which we know she is saying wrong should we confront her with evidence or let it go for the sake of not upsetting her?    Many muslim sister will be greatly awaiting and appeciative of your quick response. Jazakullah Khair&quot; &quot;"
Isam Rajab,salams we recite mowlood in the name os the holy Prophet (sa). and also invite all the family members for ameal in rabiul awwal. Is this permitted.
Isam Rajab,Ya Shayk  Is it true that the rightly guided Abu Bakr was biten by a snake while he was looking after the prophet PBUH ( i think the this was in the cave or mountain).  Is this true? If it is what cure was used against the Snake bite?
Isam Rajab,I'm sorry but your question is unclear. What's t-cell? and what's you question exactly?
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu alaikum,  If a husband commands his wife to eat a banana, or whatever, and stand on one leg. do I have to do it? In terms of being obeidient to the husband? and not to degrade her."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu Alaikum  A sister had an abortion when she was younger as her husband insisted that she did so. Due to the cultural circumstances and norms at the time, and the fact that neither the sister nor her husband were very knowledgeable or practising to a great degree, the sister believed she had to obey her husband and she unwillingly had two abortions.  She later resisted a future attempt to force her to abort another child. The sister is now elderly. What does she need to do as kaffarah? (she may not be in a position to fast consecutive months etc if that is required)."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The eyes are irrelevant in this matter. If the picture is for a full human or animal then it's prohibited to pray with it."
Isam Rajab,"I actually advise someone who's waking up late to wake up earlier instead of waking up late! The solution to wake up early is to sleep early and to try to wake up earlier instead of waking up late.   I don't think it's a good suggestion to create a thread and ask people whether they're praying in the Masjid or not. They have to pray, that's the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam at least. That's what Ibn Masoud Radiallahu Anhu said: &quot;No one misses the prayer except a one whose Iman is under question!&quot;. Maybe you'll find many people who're not praying in the Masjid, and that'll encourage others not to pray in the Masjid and they'll give the excuse that many people are not praying. That's what many people do, they compare themseleve to people less than them in matters of religion while they're supposed to compare themselves to people who are better than them. I suggest instead that you ask people who're attending the Fajr prayer how they're doing it and then the people can help each other praying in the Masjid inshallah. I believe this is a better one."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I didn't get the question! What do you mean by buying/renting/supporting? What this has to do with the religion? I think this is a legal issue not a religious issue!"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I'm not sure if the family of the person you're talking about is Muslim or not. If they're Muslims then this is too strange to find some people who claim to be muslims yet they reject the sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam who married several women and encouraged people to marry, they should be reminded that culture doesn't come before religion and religion is what we're supposed to follow not the culture."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I don't know any preference. Therefore, it depends on the individual."
Isam Rajab,"as-Salaamu `alaykum  If someone reads al-Burda, and we do not tell them about the mistakes within it, are we sinned?"
Isam Rajab,"I didn't say you give a christmas present, I said: you accept. You don't congratulate people for their falsehood. There's a difference between accepting and giving. Accepting is allowed, the narration is in Musannaf Ibn Abi Shaiba from Aisha Radiallahu Anha # 24361. Ibn Taymia Rahimahullah reported that Ali Radiallahu Anh accpted a gift from a fire worshipper in his holidy."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   according to what you mentioned it's allowed to drink milk and eat eggs."
Isam Rajab,"There are two opinions based on the meaning of Plucking. Many scholars say it's not permissible since plucking includes any hair whether thick or thin, but I believe if it's very thick then it's permissible because that's not the plucking the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam cursed the one who does itand alos that's not the real meaning of plucking where plucking means removing the hair totally and here you're not removing it totally. There's no specific evidence for ear hair so it should be permissible especially if it's compared to the hair that we're commanded to remove like the armpits and pubic hair."
Isam Rajab,"as-Salaamu `alaykum,  Is the following hadith authentic?  'Before Allah, no other intercessor will have a greater status than the Qura'an, neither a Prophet nor an angel.&quot;"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   In Islam there're more than 7 major sins. But these 7 are mentioned in particular which are shirk (Associating other gods along with Allah), Magic, killing without a justified cause, usury, eating orphan's money, turning away from the battle field and accusing an innocent woman of adultry.   The punishment of these sins vary. Shirk is not forgiven and it'll abide the one who does in hellfire forever. Killing an innocent person is also going to take the one who did it to hellfire for a very long time. Scholars differed on Magic whether it's Kufr by itself so the one will remain in hellfire for ever or not.   The one who deals with interest is cursed as the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said whether he's taking it or giving it or writing it's contract or witnessing it. It's said in the tafsir that the one who deals with riba will be given sword on the day of judgment and will be told to fight Allah Subhanahu Wata'la.   I don't know of specific punishment in addition to hell for the one eats orphan's money. The one who accuses a woman of adultry is lashed 80 times."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   In the Shfiee Mathhab it's recommended and you should perform sujud assahu if you forget it. But in their mathhab the Qunut is only in Fajr prayer and in the witr prayer of the last half of Ramadan. They perform sujud Assahu before salam always. Other scholars disagree and they say you don't have to do anything.   The sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam is to pray the Qunut before the Ruku. But there's another type of Qunut which is Qunut for calamities that inflict the Muslims, and this qunut should be performed after the Ruku in ALL prayers. Many people mix between the two. That's what Anas Radiallahu Anh mentioned to Asim who asked him about it. It's recorded in Sahih Al Bukhari. Book14: Al Witr."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes, it's reported by Attirmithi, Ibn Majah and Al bayhaqi."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum wr wb,  My younger brother used to go for Jamat. And he learned from there that when you eat something and you burp you suppose to say Alhumdullilah instead of Astagfirullah. Then my older brother said that when you burp its mean you ate a lot and Allah said whoever will burp in this world will be the most hungry person on the day of judgment.  Can you explain this statement to me. What exactly Allah or Prophet Mohammad Sallahu Alaihi Wasallam said about burping? I shall be thankful to you if you explain in detail.  Jazak Allah Khair  Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam forbade listening to Music and we believe he's the Messenger of Allah and he won't say something for no reason. Maybe we know this reason and maybe we don't but we have to follow him to prove that we believe in him. If everything was clear then there's no need for belief. Now, what if she was convinced that what we're doing is ok but still she doesn't believe in Islam?  Therefore, I adivse you to focus on the principles of Islam, we do everything because Allah says so or his Messenger says so, focus on the oneness of Allah and the uniqueness of Quran and the miracles of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam. I believe that'll help you a lot because she may ask you hundreds of questions, why we pray maghrib 3 Raka'h and why we pray 5 times a day, why we give 2.5% of the saved money and so on..."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Ok then. If you believe that you're correct and your friend is wrong. Then here are the steps of Advice: 1) Advise him in seclusion not in front of people. 2) Tell him nicely what you believe is correct and what wrong is he doing. 3) Remind him that your intention is to advise him not to pinpoint his errors. 4) Repeat your advice again with stronger words if you didn't find a response."
Isam Rajab,We respond by saying there may be many innocent people accused of rape also! Islam doesn't look to the victim only or the criminal only. It looks to both sides.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   We're not supposed to go deep in these matters because Allah is able to do whatever he wants and He has a wisdom whether we knew it or not. Allah may choose Gibreel or may not choose him. It's His creation and He does what he wants without questions.   Scholars mention several types of Wahi, once through Gibreel and once through speech directly and once through the dreams to the prophets and so on."
Isam Rajab,"Assalam Alaikum w.w. I had a question regarding the sunnah of the Prophet (SAS). Does one always pray the 2 rakah on entering the mosque, at times like: a) After Asr b) Just close to Maghrib time ( a minute or two before sunset) c) After Fajr, if the jama'a has completed their fard salat, and you enter the mosque, do you still perform the 2 rakah or it is not recommended? d) At noon? Appreciate if you can answer these questions.  Jazzak Allah Khair"
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu alaikum,  I've heard of the hadeeth before that says &quot;Dawoo mardaakum bisadaqa&quot; -- &quot;Cure you sick with charity.&quot; I had two questions about this:  1.  What is the soundness of this hadith, and where can I find it.  2.  Assuming it is sound, how do you implement it?  Can you give charity with a particular sick person in mind, and have that be your intention?  Jazakum Allahu khayran."
Isam Rajab,"I already told you that tajweed is knowing how to recite the Quran properly, not knowing the names of the rulings themselves.   You can do that by listening to a tape which is not the perfect method but that's the best you can so far right now."
Isam Rajab,As-Salaamu alaikum  Is it permissible to greet a shia' with salaam?  Also are they considered our(ahlus sunnah wal jama'ah) brothers?  Jazakum Allaahu khairan
Isam Rajab,"Yes, it's better not. I don't know from the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam that individuals used to announce publicly requests for Dua. Each person should have trust in Allah yet if you asked someone once to pray for you bearing in mind that the dua of a brother for his brother is granted then it's permissible. But I agree with you about these public duas."
Isam Rajab,"Is there any significance of having some grey hair in Islam, even if you are young?  Is it a good sign?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's really difficult to deal with this situation but here's what I have so far: 1- If you have these feelings to someone who wronged you once or twice. Try to remember how many times you wronged others and imagine if they had the same feelings against you! 2- Imagine if Allah Subhanahu Wata'la didn't forgive you and the moment you comitted a sin it was recorded and you'll never be forgiven for it what will happen? 3- Write down the names of the people that you think they wronged you, write down everything they did to you next to their names. After you do that, erase the things they did and mention only one good thing about them, then also erase it and write down: I FORGIVE THEM. Do it 5 times for one week and it'll help you inshallah. You need to pray to Allah Subhanahu Wata'la to help you and I pray for you also."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes it's permissible."
Isam Rajab,"shaykh kareem, I got married to my husband, we're very happy with each other Alhamdolillah;we love each other a lot however my friends and family are causing some problems for us. My husband has very dark complexion whereas I've very fair. We're happy with each other and I love him for who is however my family mock his skin colour. Whenever they address him they make comments and call him names then later cover it up by saying they were joking. It's really beginning to get on my nerves and it's really disturbing for my husband as well. I've talked to them and they say they're just joking and I should not take things seriously but recieving abusive comments like is affecting our relationship.  i would like to get some advice on what I should do to resolve this problem. I know i can't cut ties with my kins but this small issue in becoming a big problem since it's happening on regular basis.  thank you"

Isam Rajab,"I know that the Arabs originated from Yemen, so how come Yemenis don't speak fluent Fus7a(fushaa)?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If you started working recently then you won't be able to give Zakat unless you've worked and saved money for one year! You can give Zakat to Islamic Organizations if they work on the 8 recipients that Allah Subhanahu Wata'la specified in the Quran. If they work on other things then you can't. I'm not aware of all the works of IslamicNetwork as they have mashallah many things going on. But if it's the website and the services then no, you can give charity but not Zakat."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, Jazakallah khair for quoting the hadith with the picture! I think I already answered the question. This is an emphasis of the right of the husband over his wife."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes it's the same since the snow also harms the drivers."
Isam Rajab,"I'm sorry I didn't get the question.   If you owe a loan then you have to pay it, by not paying it may incur more interest so you should pay it.   The part that I didn't get is about hajj or hijrah. Do you mean can you do hajj while owing this money? if that's the question then the answer is Yes, usually you're not supposed to perform hajj until paying off your debt since you're not obliged to do it, or the debtor allows for you then it becomes ok since the federal government doesn't really care whether you travel or not."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   There are shayateen from jinns and there are also shayateen from humans as well.  Just like ther are humans who lead you astray and misguide you though they look like you the same thing with jinns."
Isam Rajab,"Salaam u alaikum wr  A while ago I took a number of oaths saying something along the lines of &quot; 'I swear by Allah I will NEVER EVER do this deed again &quot;- well in this case it was related to leaving specific sins. However after a while I went back to doing those sinful deeds - may Allah forgive me, I do know that I have to offer expiation/kafaaratul yameen for breaking these oaths - which I did - which was to feed 10 poor people 1.5 kg's of food for each broken oath - which in this case was feeding a hundred people as I broke 10 oaths. However after expiating for those oaths I went back again and did those deeds - does this mean I have to offer expiation again for all those oaths which I took initially - in other words do those oaths stand/continue for the rest of my life - I will have to expiate for them every time I break them or was expiating for them the first time enough as I did not re-new the oaths after the first time I expiated for them?"
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu alaikum Shaykh Isam,   My question is, what should I do if my sister is friends with someone not of good character. By not good character I mean someone that, for example used to wear hijab and then she stopped wearing hijab and she is engaged to be married but still hangs out with other guys at restaurants, etc.   I have a few questions: 1.)Should I inform my sister's friends parents about what she does? 2.)Should I let my parents know these characteristics about my sisters friend? 3.)What is the proper way to handle this situation?   Jazakhallah Khairun"
Isam Rajab,"assalamu alaikum I am wondering whether it is permissible for MEN to watch tv/movies/news if there are women on the program that are uncovering their hair/neck/etc or are wearing makeup. Many people use the excuse that if one is watching the news it's ok or if the program has no sexual content it is ok. Or they say it's ok if they are not aroused. However, most programs that show women AT LEAST show them wearing makeup (lipstick, eye makeup, etc) even if they are covering their hair. I don't see that there is any necessity in watching these programs because you can read newspapers, etc.  May Allah Reward You."
Isam Rajab,"Imam is a leader. This was mentioned several times in the Quran and it means a leader. Islamically, the Imam is the leader of the Muslims he leads them in their matters religious and secular, but in our time it's said mostly to the prayer leader and I think that's what's meant by this question. Appointing Imams as a prayer leader varies from a place to another and from country to another. Some countries have strict rules and standerds, others don't have so and based on that they may get training or they may not.  Islamically as the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said: &quot;The one who knows more of the Quran should lead the prayer&quot;. So this is how they're supposed to be appointed. The one who has knowledge of the religion (memorization and understanding).    Sharia literaly means the road leading to the destination. It was used for the road to the water. Then it became a custom word for the religion of Allah because it includes all the rules that lead to pleasing Allah Subhanahu Wata'la and paradise.  The Muslim has to establish Sharia wherever he is because Sharia is obedience to Allah Subhanahu Wata'la and we're supposed to worship Allah Subhanahu Wata'la wherever we are."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam Alaykum   Dear Shiekh Isam  My fiance asked me if I had past relationships before, something not halal... And I told a lie because I did not want to reveal my sins, especially for something I regreted and repented for. So was I suppose to tell my fiance the truth?  Even if a girl commited zina lets say, and she repented for it, should she tell him about it?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Where does she live? what's the status of her father? If she lives in a Muslim country then she could go to the judge and he removes him as a wali and gives that right to another male.   If she lives in a forign country without a muslim judge then the Islamic Center can handle this.    They have first to verify that the father is doing harm to her."
Isam Rajab,Why is it that a Muslim brother can marry a non Muslim sister but a Muslim sister can not Marry a non Muslim brother? Isn't it the same? I mean one can influence the other to come to Islam regardless of the gender...right? I just wanted to know...jazakallah kher  assalamualaykum wa rahmatulah.
Isam Rajab,Assalamu alaykum  I read one of your answers to the question of praying in the car...and that it was not allowed.  My question is i had always been told that women must be very careful not to be seen praying by non mahram men (esp. non believers). If that is true then we can't just find a hallway somewhere to pray (as i have seen brothers do say in a movie theatre or even at school finding a hall that isn't being heavily travelled).
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I know one recitation narrated in Sunan Attirmithi from Al Hasan ibn Ali Radiallahu Anhuma that the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam taught me: &quot;Allahummahdini Fiman hadait, Wa'afini fiman 'Afait, ....&quot;. That's the one I know. But you could say any dua you want."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   No he doesn't. Unless he knows that there are people who are looking at her and trying to enjoy her beauty yet he doesn't do anything about it then yes he may lack gheerah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   The person has to cover himself and asks Allah's forgiveness and should not mention his pervious sins. She is not to tell him or anyone else about her past."
Isam Rajab,"I know this sounds weird, yet if you read the texts of scholas regarding this issue, you'll be surprised how much Islam gave privilage to married women. Most of the shoclars agreed that if a woman had a servant in her father's house, then the husband should provide her one!  They all agreed that the husband can't force his wife doing things she's not used to.   It's true that the wife doesn't have to cook or clean! and this is the opinion of Imam Ashafie and Imam Ahmad, it's stated clearly in their books of fiqh. You may ask now: then what's the use of Marriage? what does the wife have to do if she doesn't have to cook or clean, etc.. Scholars say it's recommended but not a must since the marriage is to enjoy each other and live together but not to become a servant!. now there are incidents fromt he time of the Messenger sallallahu aliahi wasallam where wives used to serve their husbands, but they say: they liked to do it but they're not obliged to! The messenger sallallahu aliahi wasallam said in a hadeeth: &quot;if I were to ask a person to protsrate to another person, I'd have asked the wife to prostrate herself to her husband for the great right of his upon her&quot;! Therefore, I really can't give a clear cut answer! I'm sorry again! but it really depends on the environment, I can't ask an american wife to do the exact things an egyptian or pakistani wife does!"
Isam Rajab,"asalamalaykum wa rahmatulla wa barakatuh  What would you advice a sister who has, after a long time of struggles, no more trust nor respect for her husband because of his actions, but fears Allah and wishes to find a way to improve this or deal with this. Also, what should a wife do if she keeps advising her husband to change bad habits, but he just says insh'allah and continues doing those habits? jazakallah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   There's no specific Dua to be said for new business but you can read Quran and pray to Allah Subhanahu Wata'la to provide for you through this business. You can read quran and sprinkle water but that doesn't pertain to new businesses. Taking the Quran itself there because it's a new business is not a sunnah and if it's thought that this is for protection then it could be bida'h according to some scholars."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   5:90 { O you who believe! Intoxicants and gambling, (dedication of) stones, and (divination by) arrows, are an abomination,- of Satan's handwork: so avoid such (abomination), that ye may prosper.   The word &quot;Avoid&quot; is much greater than &quot;Don't drink&quot; it implies all types of involvment in alcohol so even carrying alcohol without drinking is prohibited. Even selling alcohol without drinking is prohibited.    Can those who tell you that alcohol is burned while cooking why then they use it if it's burned? Unless there's still an effect for it?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You can't lease money and pay it back increased! You can borrow money and pay it back with the same amount. I don't know if I got it right but here you pay $5000 and you get $50000 10 times more than what you paid, but then you still pay the $5000 per month, so you end up paying $55000 or so. So if that's the case then it's Riba. I advise these groups instead of putting money and then exchanging it, they could purchase something and divide the profit, that's much better."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu alaykum   I know we are not supposed to remove or cut our hair during Hajj but does this also apply to a woman's facial hair? If some woman dont remove the hairs on their upper lip or face, they will start growing mustaches and look like men and this can be very embarressing for them! What is the ruling regarding this?  Also, can we shave our underarms or legs during Hajj?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You can't ask for specific figures like 20 K after 3 years. Instead you could ask for 40% or so. And do not say there's no possiblity of loss. What if you made greater profits?  If it's specific figuers like 10 K or 20 K then it's prohibited but if it's 30% or 20% then it's permissible because it's investment not sale. And thus you share the profit and loss but if it's specific figuers then you'll be liable for the loss if you didn't make the 4 X agreed payment."
Isam Rajab,"Do you think it permissible and even advisable to attend demonstrations (in the land of the disbelievers) to defend the honour of the Prophet saws in regards to these recent published pictures ?  If yes, then can you go even if you parents do not want you to go?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Allah provided guidance for all mankind, but if they refuse and reject and they want to follow the Shaytan then that's what they'll get. They had the choice to obey Allah or obey Shaytan so they'll be punished if they didn't obey Allah."
Isam Rajab,"Salaam u alaikum  I suffer from intermittent urinary incontinence - whereby I leak very slight drops of urine without a detectable pattern - I wash my penis and put something over it to stop my clothes being contaminated and I pray and that it wouldn't matter if I leaked anything during prayer. So the bottom line being I have to wash my penis for each prayer and perform a fresh wudhu when the time of the next prayer enters. My question related to this is that for example, if I wash my penis (which I usually do with wet tissue) and then perform wudhu and then am about to perform wudhu, however I break wind before praying, do I in this situation just re-new my wudu, or would I have to re-wash my penis again (which would be quite demanding to every time)? Well considering I have to wash my penis for every prayer and do wudu, is it permissable for me to do wipe over (mass'ah) my socks when it comes for wudhu - knowing that there is a possibility that my penis could have leaked before I put my socks on, I was confused as what to do?  Jazak'Allah Khairan  Wasalaam u alaikum  I do apologise for the length and nature of the question. May Allah reward you."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes it's haram. You don't approve of what the disbelievers are doing nor you help them in their falsehood. This is a religious activity and you can't participate in it nor help them in it. You could mention to them clearly that Islam doesn't agree with this christmas thing."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   If you are traveling then you have the option to shorten the prayers or pray in the local Masjid but if you attend the local Masjid then you pray following them you don't pray separetly."
Isam Rajab,assalamoalaikom sheikh  Marriage to your step-mother's daughter. Valid or Not. ?
Isam Rajab,"Assalaam Alaikum,  is it permissible to practice law in the United States? why?  Jazakum Allahu Khairan"
Isam Rajab,wasalaam alaikoom  Is it permissable for me just to wipe my front private part with a dry tissue and then wet tissue to clean it after urinating or is it obligatory to wash it with water by means of pouring it on it?  May Allah elevate your station in the next life to be of those who are close to Him.  wasalaam alaikoom wa rahmatullah hi wa barakathou
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   A Muslim is supposed to be honest when he does something due to the hadeeth of Omar Radillahu Anh in Sahih AlBukhari. But if someone doesn't have a sincere intention that doesn't mean he shouldn't do it. He's supposed to purify his intention not abandon the deed."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, You don't attend a funeral in a church because the purpose of funral prayers and funeral sermons is forgiveness for the deceased and those are not forgiven so you don't attend it especially in church where it'll imply your approval of what they do which is forbidden. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam had many non muslims neighbors but he never witnessed their funerals though he cared about them and he used to give them Dawah. Scholars said if it's your parent then this is an exception where you should burry him/her as the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam told Ali Radiallahu Anh to burry his father."
Isam Rajab,"Wa alaikumussalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh There are two opinions. In the hadeeth narrated by Wael ibn Hujr in Sahih Al bukhari the Messenger Sallallahu alaihiwasallam ordered to have the organs back as they were before the Ruku, this is an indication that they should be on the chest. Others say all the narrations about the description of the prayer mentioned raising the hands but never mentioned putting them on the chest! So these are two opinions for the scholars and it should not be a debatable issue since each one has an evidence."
Isam Rajab,"salamo aleikum.  in my community we have alot of ppl calling to islam alhamdulilah and we say that some of them are shaykh and other talib ilm etc. but some ppl reject this and say that we cant call them this because one must study long time to be called this and so on.  the question is; what makes a person, or makes a person worth saying hes a shaykh or talib ilm or even alim? what are the conditions for this from quran and sunna?  jazzak Allah kheir."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If this prisoner can't get out of prison then yes it's valid. You can perform both hajj and umrah. But if he's able to get out of prison then you don't do it on his behalf, he waits until he's free then he performs it."
Isam Rajab,"Are digital images that contain peoples faces considered haraam? Or are they only haraam when they are actually printed on paper?  By digital pictures I mean, TV pictures, pictures on the internet and photos taken on mobile phones."
Isam Rajab,"salam alaykum Imam  There is a person who floated in the air about 1 feet off the ground and said he is &quot;blessed&quot;, I believe he has a jinn in him, could this be true?  Many people are amazed by him, I want to prove him wrong so what should I do?  Also is it halal to speak to jinns?"
Isam Rajab,As-Salam-Walikum   I had a question regarding urination. I mean what does the Qur抋n implies about urine. Meaning I know we aren抰 suppose to stand up and pee and make sure that the urine doesn抰 touch our body. But than I heard that if the urine does touch your body weather you be sitting and peeing or standing you would be severely punish and won抰 enter the paradise. I am confused as to what is true. And if you can suggest a method how should one keep him away from such contact. Because to me it seems that no matter how hard you try sometimes you end up with the contact. I mean yes I go right ahead and make sure I clean myself fully.    Can you please address   Walikum As-Salam
Isam Rajab,"Walaikaum Assalam,   Every time you sneeze you say Alhamdulillah, unless you sneeze more than once and there's no time to say Alhamdulillah then you say it once.   I don't know what do you mean by the dua for churches!"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If you tell them it's a gift then they may not know that you took it from them, you need to ask their forgiveness in addition to returning what you took. The only exception where you don't do this is when you're sure that more evil will happen. So if you took a book or a watch or any belonging to others you have to tell them to forgive you."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Could you please specify more as it could be stocks, cahs and many other things."
Isam Rajab,"This specific punishment came for drinking Alcohol, so if the punishment was based on the effect of alcohol then it should be the same, if not then it's only for alcohol. Since this requires an evidence from the Book of Allah or the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam I can't say whether it has the same effect or not."
Isam Rajab,Are you allowed to call the cops on your abusive brother? If its that serious and he doesnt listen to his parents?
Isam Rajab,Not without their consent. Can you carry a regular camera and picture people! it's the same.
Isam Rajab,"Which types of TV( satelite, cable, antenna) are permissible even though most TV nowadays contains unlawful commercials especially when your intention is not to watch the commericials but to watch the educational or sport content?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I really don't know. You need to track the name all the way back to make sure whether it's true or false. Nevertheless, we judge the actions and the beliefs not the names and lables."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You could show this lecture if you feel there's a benefit out of it, also you could put a disclaimer just to be in the safe side. Remember that avoiding the people of Bida' doesn't mean abandoning them totally or deserting them especially in this country. Imam Al bukhari narrated from people of Ahl Al Bida' but with conditions of course. So it should be ok inshallah, next time if you have a better speaker for the same subject then it may be better as well."
Isam Rajab,"Fear of forgetting the Quran should not stop you from memorizing it. It should encourage you to give it more time. However, the companions used not to exceed 10 ayat until they apply them so they learnt knowledge and application. It's very beneficial to understand what you're memorizing so you wont forget it inshallah. I don't recall any authentic hadeeth about the punishment for forgetting the Quran. However, it's known by scholars that forgetting the Quran is usually due to one thing: commiting sins! We all need to review the Quran always, the Messenger Sallallahu aliahi wasallam said that it's very easy to be forgotten."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   No wonder people celebrate the wrong day since it's essentialy an innovation.  The first time muslims innovated this thing was after the year 400 of Hijra as Imam Ibn Katheer stated in his book of History. Therefore, you'll never find one of the great scholars such as the 4 Imams &quot;Abu Hanifa, Malik, Ashafie and Ahmad&quot; or any other scholar did it or recommended it."
Isam Rajab,"assalamu alaikum, is there a good islamic book I could give my husband to learn about intimate relations? After a few years of marriage  he thinks that it is abnormal that I am not satisfied by regular intercourse (ie what satisfies him), but he is wilng to do what would help me. There are no health problems in either of us, alhamdulillah, so it's due to a lack of knowledge on both of us. nonmuslim books often have pictures or recommend haram actions (masturbation without spouse) to learn."
Isam Rajab,Can a women go for umraa without any of her mehraam with one of only women group that is going?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If he didn't believe in Islam and he never applied it then he's not a Muslim so you can't say he left Islam! But if he believed and then he disbelieved then yes the punishment should be applied."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   If both are exactly the same then yes you pick and choose but if you believe there's a larger group then you go with them, if you believe there's more knowledgable group or righteous group then you go with them."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Yes it's the same ruling, if you'll benefit then you can go, if you don't or there are sins then you can't go."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, If he said that he divorced her twice then of course they're divorced. Unless he's mentally sick in a way that doctors say he's unaware of what he says or does then divorce doesn't occur from him. The divorce from the mentally ill person is invalid."
Isam Rajab,"assalaamu alaykum  I was at my masjid last night and I was looking for a book to read from the bookshelf. Every book I came across seemed to be very reliable and based on authentic Islamic information. Then my eyes fell on one book that I was surprised to find. It contained very incorrect information on Tawheed and Shirk and I would never reccomend just anyone to read it.   Currently there is no stable Imam at the masjid due to a calamity that hit the community, and the Lajnah is also very unstable so I do not know who to contact about this. It is possible that this book was just placed on the shelf by any member in the community.   My question is: am I allowed to remove that book from the bookshelf without telling anyone? I know it is not my property, but I fear that it will miseducate the people on Shirk and I do not feel comfortable that such a book is even in our masjid.   Also, is a woman allowed to be on the Board of a Masjid, considering she significantly contributes financially to it etc. ?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, If the laws of the land fulfill the Islamic requirements for marriage then yes it's lawful. If not, then it's not lawful. Most countries give you license so you could go to a Masjid or a Church but they don't conduct the marriage itself in the court."
Isam Rajab,"AssalamuAlikum Somebody mentioned that Prophet Muhammad (Peach be Upon Him) while married to Khadija (May Allah be Pleased with her) was also married to umm Habiba(May Allah be Pleased with her)  at the same time. I looked this information in Qadhi Iyaads Shifa, Mubarkapuris Raheeq but did not find it there. i asked my teacher and he said this is the first time he heard it. Ya Sheikh could u direct me to the refrence where this mentioned if it is true (preferbly refrence in arabic)"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, so she's your uncle's wife? NO she's not a mahram in both cases."
Isam Rajab,"There is a general tendency nowadays to form groups by some agents for 慤mrah. The problem with this method of 慤mrah is that some of the ladies also want to perform 慤mrah but they do not have a Mahram to accompany them. In the process, what the agents do is to declare some males in the group as Mahram of these ladies so that the official requirement is fulfilled. I wanted to know whether this kind of subterfuge is allowable in Islam? these groups consist of subgroups of ladies who then perform the 慤mrah rituals quite satisfactorily and independently"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   No there wasn't. Other women were from the Ansar. I hope you understand that they didn't sit and celebrate and the prophet Sallallahualaihi wasallam was sitting with them as some people now do! They prepared Aisha Radiallahu Anha for the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam."
Isam Rajab,I don't recommend this specific form since it was not done exactly by the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam or his companions but I also can't say it's bid'ah since there's a validity of it if the person wanted to implement the hadith of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam when he said that the dua of the fasting person is answered. And supplicating Allah Subhanahu Wata'la through the good actions is a valid form of dua just like the story of the three people who entered the cave and it was blocked by a rock then they supplicated Allah Subhanahu Wata'la through mentioning their good actions. So if the person did it with this in mind I don't see anything wrong with it yet I don't recommend doing it on regular basis provided that it was not done by the Messenger Sallallahualaihi Wasallam.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Usually talaq happens in anger, I don't remember someone came to me and told me I divorced my wife while I was smiling. The only case where some scholars considered talaq is null when it happens in a state of unusual rage where the man can't understand what he's saying, which is very rare to happen. They could return to each other if it wasn't the third time they're divorced, but they have to have a new contract with a new mahr since it was 6 months as you said. The correct thing is to contact the local Imam or Islamic Center to do this for them."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, There's a practice by Abu Bakr Radiallahu Anh that when someone praised him he used to say O Allah you know me better than them and I know myself better than them, O Allah make me better than what they think and forgive me for what I did and they don't know about it and don't hold me accountable for what they are saying. You should remember your shortcomings when someone does that and you should be honest. Their praise won't help you except if Allah Subhanahu Wata'la is pleased with you."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahamtullahi Wabarakatuh,   Chatting online is no different that chatting live. Is it permissible to stop in the market or in the street and talk to someone?   So it's divided to 3 types: If it's necessity then you can talk as long as you have to. such as if there's a surgery. If it's a need then you talk as long as you need to such as if you purchased something and you were talking to the seller. If it's not but a waste of time then it's unlawful."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   Unfortunately this problem is common now and the reason is that people are focusing on how much they memorize instead of focusing on how strong is their memorization! My advice to the one who forgets the moment he starts a new portion is to stop memorizing! What's the use if you're memorizing but you're forgetting so quickly?   It's much easier when you start with solid memorization, it'll pay off when you need to review the Quran. But if you don't start with a good memorization then most likely you'll never be able to remember what you memorizaed later. Just like the one who builds a house without a foundation! His focus on the top while he needs to work on his foundation.   Anyway, even with strong memorization, you still need useful methods to review the Quran and one of them is to read what you memorized in your prayer. Don't repeat the same surahs in your prayer. That'll help a lot. Also you should have some portion to be read before you sleep. Aisha Radiallahu Anha mentioned few surahs the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam used to read every night before he sleeps. If you apply this always I guarantee you a strong memorization. Then there are few methods I mentioned in one of my lectures, it's recorded with muslimaudio but I don't believe it's sufficient so I'm planning to do another one inshallah with more methods maybe in UK soon inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"Calling someone absent for something he's unable to do (like the example you gave) is shirk. For Allah says : {'Nor call on any, other than Allah;- Such will neither profit thee nor hurt thee: if thou dost, behold! thou shalt certainly be of those who do wrong} Wrong here means shirk."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's not true that the hadeeth included Kafir, it pertains only to a Munafiq. This hadeeth is authentic and narrated in Abi Dawood, Al hakim and others. The companion who narrated this hadeeth is Buraidah Radiallahu Anh.   So again this hadeeth pertains to the Munafiq who shows Islam and conceals disbelief.   The meaning of this hadeeth is that you shouldn't let the hypocrites rule or control you.   It's ok to tell your non Muslim educator : Teacher or Ustath."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes she can refuse him. I believe you asked me this question before and I already gave you the answer.   Barirah Radiallahu Anha refused to go back to Mughith Radillahu Anh who used to cry and follow her."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu Aleykum Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh, Sheikh I had been dreaming of my best friend for quite some time, as she was pregnant, but everytime I saw her in my dream she would be dressed in black. Does that mean anything?  Jezak Allah Kheir."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The salah by all means is correct whether he was silent for a reason or he just forgot to recite a loud.  If his silence was because he recited Al Fatiha in secret then again there's nothing wrong with that and he doesn't even have to do sujud assahw because it's permissible to recite in silent what you're supposed to recite aloud. I think I already answered this. If his silence was for something else then it depends on what was the reason for that? If he just delayed it then that's incorrect but it doesn't effect the validity of the prayer. So the prayer by all means is correct."
Isam Rajab,"The moment you recite the Quran, you'll get the reward inshallah. It's always recommended to pounder on the meaning, sometimes it's mandatory. yet, for your case it's Ok inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"I'm sorry, yes it's breastfed. I already said adoption is haram in Islam in a sense that you give the same name or the same rights like a son or a daughter, so it should be clear inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, Being cautious is not a sin. You don't have to talk to every single Muslim. If he's your friend then it's better to tell him what you feel and listen to his answer. You should love for him what you love for yourself, that's what the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said. So imagine if he's the one who has these feelings, what do like him to tell you?"
Isam Rajab,"Asalam aleikum wa rahmatallah wa barakatu  Is it true if you reject a suitor who meets all your requirements for no valid reason, you will be held accountable for it on Qeyamat? There is supposedly a hadeth about this, could you please refer me to it?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Setting up traps is allowed to catch animals for food. If you can slaughter the animal then why can't you set up a trap! However, it depends on the trap, if it kills the animal without shedding blood then you can't eat from it like if the animal was trapped for few days and starved to death. The trap should be made just to catch the animal so you could slaughter it and once you slaughter it you say Bismillah."
Isam Rajab,"Assalaamualaykum wa rahmatullah,   A friend of mine who celebrates the prophet sallalahu alayhi wasallam's birthday quoted this hadith to me and i was confused and wondering if you can tell me the context of it and what is implied by a &quot;good biddah (innovation)&quot;:   &quot;This hadith was mentioned by Imam Muslim in his Sahih, through the route of Jarir ibn ^Abdillah that the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said:   This means:  &lt;&lt;The one who innovates a good innovation in Islam has its reward and the reward of those who practice it until the Day of Judgement, without lessening the rewards of those who practice it. The one who innovates the innovation of misguidance carries this sin and the sins of those who practice it until the day of Judgement, without lessening the sins of those who practice it.&gt;&gt; &quot;    JazakAllahu khair."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamo Alaykum  I know it is obligatory for a wife to 'obey' her husband. With that said, is it her Islamic duty or fard upon her to cook, clean, and do housework? I understand she should do these things to keep marital harmony and bliss but is the housework a favor she is doing or something that is ordained by Allah as her husband's right such as sexual relations or taking care of the children?  I have heard conflicting opinions on this issue. Please tell me the evidences for whichever one you believe to be correct. Jazaak Allah."
Isam Rajab,So if someone included Allah's name then it becomes halal? This is not right and it's not true.
Isam Rajab,is it from the sunna for the spouses to have intercourse on the first night?
Isam Rajab,"Assalamualaikum:  If one has a a sick relative, in which it hurts the grandfather to get up and do wudhoo, does he have to get up each time to make wudhoo or is tayyammum sufficient?  Also, what if the patient is completely sedated, b.c. he is on a machine that helps his lung breathe, but the patient might be able to hear. Is allowed to pray and make tawbah and all of these things.  Please let me know  Assalamualaikum.    Assalamualaikum."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh, No it's not necessary, actually it became a phenomena that once someone said Salafi he's given a credit right away while our actions judge us not our lables. Imam Malik Rahimahullah when he was asked about Ahlussunah Waljama'h who they are? He said those who don't have other name to be known with!"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   I don't believe the scenario is different, it's the same. Allah says in the Quran {Avoid it} so you can't come and say I'm not drinking it I'm only rinsing my mouth with it! The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam cursed ten people because of Khamr (alcohol) not only the one who drinks it.   Also I strongly disbelieve that it's the only way! The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said about it it's a disease not a cure!"
Isam Rajab,"AssalamuAlikum,  Somebody was given Shahadah and they uttered only Lailaha ilala muhammad ar rasool ullah instead of starting with Ashhadu ana lailaha.... is this ok...."
Isam Rajab,Ruqya is a protection by the ayat and the thikr when someone is having problems or even physical injury.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes he didn't marry, I'm not sure if there's a specific reason but he was so consumed with the matters of the Muslim Ummah. Imam Ahmad was married when he was 38."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's your job to advise them, you have to do so as a caring Muslimah.   Instead of telling you what to do or say, I'll ask you how would you like a sister approaches you if you were in their shoes? Would you like her to ignore you and keep you going astray? or you would love someone to come and advise you?   I didn't like it when you said &quot;I'm afraid she's going to say it's my life&quot;! Of course she'll say that at the beginning, what do you expect from her? To tell you yes you're right and to stop doing that immediately?    When she says no, and she tells you to mind your own business then your real job as a caring Muslimah starts. Maybe it's good at the beginning to create a stronger relationship with her without telling her anything, and then after a short time you start showing her good books that you're reading about Islam, then you may remind her with her religion and the greatness of it."
Isam Rajab,They can't be fed &quot;Najis&quot; because that'll effect their meat. If you have strong doubts then try to be on the safe side and eat what's fed the organic food.
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu alaikum,  My sister is going to be having her baby soon.  Living in non-Muslim country like America, almost ALL baby items (clothes, diapers, high chairs, swings, car seats, etc) have cartoon images of animals/babies. We know it is haraam to put up pictures within the house, but would it also be a sin for the baby to wear a shirt with a picture on it, or a diaper with a cat on it, or to use a swing or carseat with a cartoon giraffe on it? (just some examples...).   Although there are not many choices, my sister does try to choose items with no images on them when buying them herself, but the MAJORITY of GIFTS family and friends give (clothes, toys, car seats, etc) all have cartoon images on them. Can they be used? If not, what do we do with all of them?  We just wanted to clarify this issue so we don't fall into any haraam or start out the babies life with sinful things.   Jazakallah khair."
Isam Rajab,"Your husband's intention is not enough for divorce, if he said something with the intention of divorce then divorce happens. So if he told you to leave him and he inteded divorce then you start counting the iddah from the day he said so. It's not permissible for you to talk to a stranger man while you're still married and it's not permisisble for a stranger man to tell you I love you if you're married. Once you're divorced then it's permissible for a man to hint but not to declare his intention. So if your iddah is not over yet then it's forbidden for you and for him to talk openly about marriage. That's what Allah says in Surat Al Baqarah. Once your iddah is over then you're free to propose to him or he proposes to you."
Isam Rajab,"Dear Sir In Islam,                          ASALAMU ALAIKUM WARAHAMATUL LAH                      I am very happy to write you this wonderful and ansome letter.How are you doing all?Hope is fine.The main motive for writing you this letter is that i just want you to know about my condition.The condition is about the children who their father sack them b'cos they have change from christian to muslim most of them wanted to become muslim, just that i dont have the araic tools,i would have get more people and others are muslims but  they dont know the teachings of thier religion thats Islam.So i planned to openend a school of muslims  just for men because i just wanted to help them.And now trully i used all my money in building and constructions work.But now the school have been completed but i dont have some islamic books and qur'ans to put them in the school so students who comes there may learn about Islam and know the teachings of Allah and His messengers.So please as im writing to you now some of the students have come to lear but because of lack of qur'ans and islamic books some of them use to go back to their places.So please i really know you are muslims like us thats why i really ask for help.infact they walk for about 10mitters b4 they reach there but they always come and go away.But remember that Allah says in His Holy qur'an that any muslim who will help the other He Allah will bless Him/Her in all his/her jobs.I would be grateful even if you should them within a period of one week because there are no islamic books and qur'ans in the library.I will like to end here but here is my address in case of sending the items:  Musah rahman Schools Of Muslims men P.O.BOX(ao)188 Aboabo-Kumasi Ghana-W/A.                   May almighty Allah bless you all.Hope to hear from you soon.                                         Yours Faithfully                                         Musah Abdul Rahman"
Isam Rajab,Assalamulaikum......im married for two years....and had three time missed carriage.....for the fourth pregnancy also the doctor told me it is not confirm i will have normal pregnancy(maybe it will be missed carriage again)...so i asked my husband to married second one(because i could'n give him a baby)...is it allowed islamically?
Isam Rajab,The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam taught the companions to be ambitious and he told them if they asked for Paradise they should ask for the highest level of it. So ask for the highest level of Jannat Al Firdaus.
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum,   Bhukari narrated from Umm`Atiyaah in which she says, &quot;we used to be commanded to go out on the day of eid, and we even brought the virgins out of their seclusion, and the menstrauting women, who would stay behind the people, joining in their takribat and duaas, hoping for blessing and purity of that day.&quot;  So my question is that the menstruatiing women can go inside the praying area? or they can join them but can't go inside the praying area?  Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's very difficult to limit the deeds to one thing and say this is the best deed because people are different and what may be suitable for them may not be suitable for others, that's why the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam didn't give one answer when he was asked this quesiton. Once he said: To believe in Allah and His Messenger, then to perform jihad in the cause of Allah then to perform Hajj. In another occasion he said: &quot;To pray on time, then to be dutiful to your parents then to perform jihad&quot;. So it depends on the person and his capabelity. But in general, the obligatories are most beloved to Allah Subhanahu Wata'la as He said in the divine narrative: &quot;And My servant will not come closer to Me with anything more beloved to Me than what I made obligatory on him&quot;."
Isam Rajab,"Akhi, inshallah if you're able to visit me after I return from Hajj we could talk and find best options inshallah. I pray @ Mission Bend Masjid in South West Zone. I'll be back on Jan.16th inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"ASALAM O ALIKUM,  Hand sanitizers contain 62% ethyl alcohol. Is using hand sanitizers haraam, since it contains alcohol?  When we use hand sanitizer, alcohol doesn't absorb in the skin. Is it still haraam?   Please explain in detail  Jazak Allah Khair  Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,"I actually had a hard time finding this hadith since you mentioned the translation only. I have the Musand of Imam Ahmad so if you could tell me who's the companion who narrated this hadith that would be great. I understand that this hadith gives so much right to the husband upon his wife, which is true. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam mentioned that if he were to command a human being to prostrate to another human being I would have commanded the wife to prostrate herself to her husband. So I think this hadith should be understood in this context if it's authentic."
Isam Rajab,"there are 2 opinions in regards to this matter: 1- it's haram. 2- it's halal. but that's if it's true you'll be able to pay it off before interest starts. the reason why there are 2 opinions: those who say: it's haram, they say: regardless of the fact that you're able to pay it off without interest, as long as you agree on this term in the contract, then it's haram, if the contract itself mentions a condition which is haram, then you can't do it. the others said: as long as you don't fall into haram, then it's ok, because you didn't really do Riba."
Isam Rajab,Yes you should obey them since there's no sin involved here.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Well, it could be riba if you can retrieve the $200 cash then it becomes paying $180 and getting $200 cash and that's riba, but I don't think you can do that with the gift cards or so which means it's ok as long as you purchase goods and things, becasue it's just like getting 10% discount of a $200 worth which is ok."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If someone else asked this question then it's ok but you already studied and you know that there are more than the 4 Imams! I'm kind of disappointed Adeel."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamualaikum,                         I needed to ask you a question that, are men allowed to wear clothes if there is 51% linen and 49% silk. Can you plzz help me.                                                                      Jazak Allah-u-Khair"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalm,   Touching the Najasa doesn't make you Najis, you only have to clean the impurity so it's not an issue. But the issue is touching the private part of the baby. Scholars have two opinions. Whoever considered the baby like the adult said it invalidates the Wudu and whoever didn't consider that said it doesn't nullify it. I already answered this question maybe 2 weeks ago."
Isam Rajab,Assalamu alykum sheikh.  I hope this question finds you in the best of health and imaan.   My question is- what should a woman wear when standing up to pray? Is it permissible to wear trousers (when she is at home)? And does she have to cover her feet? What happens if the socks she is wearing have holes in them?  I'm only asking these question because sometimes i find myself in this situation.   Jazzak Allah khier
Isam Rajab,Asalam-u-Alaikum  Please let us know the meaning and origin of the word &quot;Aarij&quot; along with references and whether it is a suitable name for a muslim boy.  Wasalam.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   No I don't know a specific dua for that."
Isam Rajab,You're not supposed to say dua in Ruku whether in Arabic or in any other language.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, I actually believe that you should answer this question yourself. Why you're studying Islam? People should have reasons for what they do. Money is definately not everything. If money is everything then it would've benefited Qaroon whom Allah has caused the earth to swallow. Allah says in the Quran {But seek the abode of the Hereafter in that which Allah has given you and neglect not the portion of the world}. So if the wealth is not used to please Allah Subhanahu Wata'la then it's nothing. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam says as in Sunan Attirmithi: &quot;This world is cursed and everything in it is cursed but the rememberence of Allah, and a scholar and a learner&quot;. So, yes we have to build this earth and we have to take provisions but all of this is for one purpose: To worship Allah Subhanahu Wata'la alone."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   What's forbidden is to burn people with fire because only Allah Subhanahu Wata'la punishes with it. Usually people die due to the explosion itself. Again, what's forbidden is burning them."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamualikum,                             We live in U.S.A.. My daughter is in sixth grade. They do singing and acting but we are trying to convince the people that we can't do singing and acting. We told them that its in our religion and we also said that its in the Holy Quran. They say they want more details so, what do we tell them so they will understand?                                                                                                                                                                          Jazak Allahu Khair"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, I'm not sure what time zone you're talking about! If he prayed before time then he needs to re pray again. Prayer before time doesn't count. It's very easy to know the time especially for Maghrib. If he prayed after time then he doesn't need to redo the prayer again."
Isam Rajab,"Bismillaahirrahmanirrahim - Am I a hypocrite?  Salamu Aleykum Wa Rahmatullah,  I dont know how to explain my situation. I'm a Niqabi, I dont go out much except to the mosque &amp; to meet with other sisters. I pray my 5 salah, I pray sunnah salah almost everytime, I used to fast a lot (dawood (as) fast) now I only fast the 3 white days every month. I make dua after every salah, and I read/listen to Quraan everyday ( I weep almost everytime when I read the Quran) and when I make dua I also cry alot. but sometimes some doubts pop-up in my head, I say authobillaah and make istighfar, but I'm so scared ya sheikh, that maybe these thoughts are poping in my head because maybe I have a disease in my heart or worse maybe im a Hypocrite (authobillah).  Im so afraid just thinking about it makes me cry, while writing this I'm also crying..... I dont want to be a hypocrite. I now I'm am a muslim and I dont want to doubt, I believe in Allah and the last day but sometimes I have these doubts. Deep down I hope its just shaytaan, but I need to ask some one knowledgeable (You) becauase I dont want to risk that I might have a disease in my heart because if I do I want to cure it bi-ithnillah &amp; get rid of it, la ilaha ill Alah, I dont want to die as a hypocrite... Im so afraid.....   My Question is am I a hypocrite and are these doubts caused by a sickness that I might have in my heart? (authobillaah)  If so, how do I get rid of it?  &amp; even if Im not a hypocrite (Inshallah) then how do I make it stop?  (I dont get these doubt all the time Al hamdulillah ?just sometimes they pop up)  Inshallah you can explain this to me with some hadiths or the like.  Jazakallahu-khair."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,     According to the Majority of scholars witr prayer is not an obligation so you don't make it up. According to the Hanafi school of thought witr prayer is wajib so you should make it up. The first opinion is much stronger and based on it no you don't make up witr prayer."
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu alaykum  Where any of the companions of the prophet (salallahu alayhi wasalam) married to more than one woman? for example was Umar, Abu bakr, Uthman etc (radiallahu anhum) narrated to have had more than one wife?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Naming the angel of death &quot;Azrail&quot; is not approved by many scholars since it's not mentioned in any authentic hadeeth.   I'm sorry but I don't know a hadeeth describes the angel himself and how he'll look like."
Isam Rajab,"AssalamuAlikum,  I would like to ask about the book Aqeedah Ibn Aasakir. Is this book ok to read or does contain deviant views."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You have to trust in Allah. Rely on him not on your ability or knowledge. Worrying about the future won't change the future itself, remember that you will only get your provision and no one will take your provision which Allah has already destined.   More hard work and more study will guarantee you inshallah success over others, purify your intention to please Allah Subhanahu Wata'la and you'll be better inshallah.   I ask Allah Subhanahu Wata'la to grant you success in this life and in the hereafter."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, And what is your question?"
Isam Rajab,Is it a sin to say things like 'idiot' under one's breath or to show visible irritation when people annoy you by stupidity (especially if they are older)? What should one do in such frustrating circumstances?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's better to put something on you but you don't have to. It's permissible to bathe naked."
Isam Rajab,"salamu alaikum  a man goes to the loo to urinate. nothing special. when he finishes and looks down to clean himself he sees semen leaking down. he didnt feel anything, it just was there. now i believe that i know that naturally semen comes out with urine when u go to the toilet but u never see it as it is mixed with the urine. this however is the same except the semen either was delayed or in large amounts. is it right to say the man should make ghusl?  jazakhallahukhair"
Isam Rajab,"Assalamualaykum I work at a manufacturing plant, they dont have a specific place to pray, so there is a change room/locker room , there is no specific area in this locker room for me to pray, but there is a shower area that has a curtain to cover it so i go inthere pray, I wanted to knw is this ok considering there is a shower area, but this is only limited to showering so no toilets around, and the shower area is covered by a door, so i pray beside that door...is there anything wrong in this?"
Isam Rajab,"as salaamu 'alaykum wa ruhmatuallaah  Ustaadh, there is this brother who married a hindu woman and now has children with her.  Back in his country Muslims marryign hindus is a common thing and he did not know it is haraam.  So the question is was he commiting zina all this time and are his children considered bastards even though this was based upon ignorance?   Jazaakullaah khayr  as salaamu 'alaykum wa ruhmatuallaah"
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu alaykum  If a brother proposed to me in marriage and i declined the offer, Islamically am i allowed to tell to my friends about the proposal? Or should that be kept secret so as to not embaress the brother who prposed? What is the islamic view on this?"
Isam Rajab,I'm sorry I never heard that kind of dua's!
Isam Rajab,Changing the underwear depends on the impurity if it was not removed by rinsing water then yes you have to change the underwear. Scholars tolerate though a very small size of the impurity like a coin or so because it's very difficult to have it clean 100%. If you clean the impurity and you do wudu then that's all what you have to do.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   The Imam can act as the Muslim judge and in that case he contacts the husband and tells him whether to divorce his wife or he'll issue the divorce himself after studying the case. So yes this is possible and it happens just like the khul' happens."
Isam Rajab,The majority of scholars consider Khul something different than Divorce so they don't count it from the divorce. So there are two opinions in this matter.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, I'm not sure I understood the question but if you meant is it a condition to have the milk directly from the breast then I say no you don't have to. If the mother pumps the milk and then gives it then it has the same verdict."
Isam Rajab,"Assalaam Alaikum Dear Shaykh,  I have a quick question.  I have a flight at 5:03 pm. Asr starts at 5:07. I land at 8:53pm (well after Asr ends)  Do I pray it with Duhr before I leave, in the plane, or when I get to my destiniation?  Jazakum Allahu Khairan for your time.  Assalaam Alaikum"
Isam Rajab,can a woman pray with stockings even though she can still see her feet through them?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam reminded people to trust in Allah Subhanahu Wata'la and He will provide for them. Maintaining the worship to Allah guarantees the provision and sinning may deprive the servant from provision as the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said. Remember to ask Allah Subhanahu Wata'la always for provision. That's what I can think of right now."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   When someone is declared bankrupt he'll be prevented from using his money until the debts are paid off, if he has properties then they'll be sold with the exception of the necessary things that he needs which can vary from time to time and from a place to another. The purpose is one which is to pay off his debts. whatever was collected will be paid to the creditors and then they can't ask him again and he's relieved."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It was the red sea not the dead sea. Although it's a dead sea but it's not really a sea, it's a lake!  The dead sea is far from Egypt and Musa Alaihissalam with his people were in Sina after they were saved from Pharaoh and that necessitates it was the red sea."
Isam Rajab,i am planning on taking a trip overseas for 2 months to visit family with my brother as my mehram.  my husband has not said so explicitly but he has been acting as if he does not want me to go.  he says i should do whatever makes me happy even if it doesnt make him happy.  should i still go or should i stay?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarkatuh,   Traveling in general is forbidden for a woman without a mahram. If this job is needed for your mother in law and she can't survive without it then it's permissible for her to travel if she doesn't have a mahram. There's an opinion of some scholars mentioned that if the road is safe then she could travel."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You don't have to tell them. Nothing forbids looking through more than one candidate. This happend at the time of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam when Fatima Bint Qais came consulting him because two men proposed to her so this is totally fine."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes this hadith is authentic. But you need to understand the definition of the land of the kuffar first. The land of the kuffar is the land that's ruled by kuffar and the rituals of Islam can't be implemented. If you're in a land where you could worship Allah freely then this hadith is not applied. People who live amongst the kuffar to increase their number or their wealth are disobeying the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam because he said: &quot;He's not from me he who lives amongst the polytheists&quot;. When you live among them, you should intend to spread the message of Islam and worship Allah. If you don't have this intention then you should reside there. The matter varies depending on the person and the country itself also."
Isam Rajab,"asalamu alaikum Sheikh  A sister is travelling abroad with her mahram (her nephew) to study at an islamic institution.  She will be living in accomodation for sisters only and her mahram will live in accomodation for brothers only, both blocks are very close to each other and the insitution only provides this type of accomodation unless they go search for themselves for an appartment which would be more expensive, time consuming and they would lose out in terms of the out of hours extra study classes that are held in the halls.   My question is:  Is this type of living arrangement allowed, or does the mahram have to live with the sister under the same roof?  Barakallaahu feek in advance  was-salam"
Isam Rajab,"What do you do in prayer if you are not sure how many prostrations you have done - for example you don't know if you've done 1 or two - do you do prostration for forgetfulness - and if you do, do you do it before or after taslim?"
Isam Rajab,And what's memthol?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I read it in the book of Imam AlGhazali &quot;Ihya' Uloom Addin&quot; but it's not authentic story. I don't know if there's a reference for it or not but I remember that it's a weak story."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I don't see any dilemma in this picture, Al hamdulillah the lines seem straight. The rows don't have to be equal. As long as it's straight then that's what counts.    I don't prefer having the very young boys praying with the adults since they'll disturb them, it's very good to educate them and teach them how to pray but I don't think having them with the adults will help. If they pray separately that's much better. I have previous experience wen I was a principal and that's what I found."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikumassalam,   It's permissible to play sports as long as it doesn't keep you from the worship of Allah Subhanahu Wata'la. Then thing with professional sports is not about getting hurt. This is something uncertain. However, paying those athletes these huge chunkc of moneys is the problem as many scholars forbade that due to the hadith of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam when he forbade payments for playing except the types of playing that helps in Jihad (Which is obviously not NFL, NBA, NHL and so on..)."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu alaikum,  What is the ruling on a Muslim serving jury duty?  Is it the same for a sister as it would be for a brother?  Excuses are rarely granted, but should a sister request an excuse to try to get out of jury duty?   And what should one SAY to get out of jury duty?  Jazakum Allahu khayran."
Isam Rajab,It's better to solve this before your death. You don't want to write in your will something not recommended. You can write something to your son himself and then he can choose.
Isam Rajab,Assalamulaikum.....i had save money with niyat going for Umrah....can i post pone my niat for the long period.....and can i use the money for other purposes?  Wassalam
Isam Rajab,"I think I already answered the Question. You already asked about the ruling whether it's permissible or not and I already answered that it's not only haram but it's a major sin.   If you're now asking another question, please verify it."
Isam Rajab,"asalam o alikum wr wb,  Is that okay to put your beard in different kind of shapes? For example: French style. And also it will be great if you give some evidence.  Jazak Allah Khair  Asalam o alikm wr wb"
Isam Rajab,There are alot of muslims out there who curse alot.  How can you explain the them that using foul language is bad  ?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Rain could be a mercy from Allah Subhanahu Wata'la or a punishment. Thus the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam sought refuge with Allah from a rain that is a punishment and asked a rain which is mercy. In regards to Thunder, Allah mentioned in the Quran that it glorifies Him. That's what we should believe. There are some narrations from Ibn Abbas Radiallahu Anhuma says that it's an angel takes and transfers the coulds. I know not any authentic hadith says that it's a sign from Allah Subhanahu Wata'la that He's upset."
Isam Rajab,Asalamu alaykum  In the case of marriage is a wali always male relative?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If you don't find any male then it's permissible, but it's very hard to believe that you can't find a male dentist in your area, it's one of the most popular and very well paid jobs in USA."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   A good answer for your question requires at least 10 pages or so. But in simple terms Islam gave clear rulings with limited number of ayat of the Quran and traditions of the Messenger Sallallahulaiahi wasallam. There are some rulings are not totally clear and require some investigation and that's the job of the scholars, then there are the endless incidents that we have and again it's the job of the scholars to come and find the answer based on the book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahulaiahi wasallam. So you won't find everything clear cut in the Quran or the Sunnah. But you'll find the guidlines and the major rulings."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Your question requires lots of time to be answered properly but I can say the following: 1- Full obedience to the parents. The only exception is when they ask you to disobey Allah.  When the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam was asked about the one who deserves the best of friendship and companionship he responded: Your mother three times and then he said your father. So they have to be before anyone else. 2-No matter whatever you do you can't pay them back. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said in sahih muslim: The son will never reward his father fully unless he finds him as a slave, so he purchases him and then he sets him free. That's the only time when the son will be able to pay back his father. but He'll never be able to pay back his mother. 3- There's no difference between the Muslim parent and the non Muslim parent. Most of the ayat of being dutiful to parents were sent down for non muslim parents when their children accepted Islam.   I answered this question several times before so I hope this addition is helpful."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullah,   Yes it's true, that's the dom of the rock where the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam ascended to heavens. The other Masjid is almost 500 meters away from it. I hope Abu Ilyaas can do something about it since he's expert inshallah in this and you can see exactly which one is AlMasjid Al Aqsa."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Actually, the hafith himself will be given this crown but his parents will be clothed with two pieces of garments which are better than the entire world."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I'm not sure about &quot;All&quot; battles, there's no authentic hadeeth describes &quot;All&quot; but I'm sure that Muslims will win the great battle and they'll win against the Jews and they'll open Rome. There might be some battles in the middle but I can't give a definite answer."
Isam Rajab,"somehow we're doing a worship! because being dutiful to our mothers is one of the best types of worship. so we shouldn't do that copying the non muslims!  we should not celebrate other than the 2 eids, yet if there's an even that has nothing to do with religion, then there's no harm of celebrating, yet that doesn't apply here! hence we have two opinions regarding celebrating the birthday, a lot say: it's haram, others say: it's not!"
Isam Rajab,"Asalaam oe aleikoum wr wb,  I would like to know if it is lawful to visit someone who is able to heal sorcery (ofcourse if Allah wants it to be heald, because no one can heal someone else without the wil of Allah)by destroying it? And if someone is able to do this, does that mean that this person uses the powers of the djin to do so? And i mean someone who does fear Allah, and does not do anything that is Haram. What are the rules of sharia in this? And what can a person do except having sabr and praying?   I read this on a site and would like to know if it is true, because if it is true that means that one could visit some one who is able ofcourse with the willing of Allah to destroy sorcery, without causing sin.  It says......  Also, some scholars in the Hanafi school differentiated between one who learned sorcery in order to avoid it or to defend against it as opposed to one who learns it believing that it is lawful, believing that he can get some benefit from it or believing that the devils will do his bidding - this latter one is definitely a disbeliever.  and what about a paper with words en codes on it that can protect one other from getting sorcery, but with the perseption that who believes that this paper can potect him, knows that this can only with the willing of Allah, is it then permissible, or doesent that make any different."
Isam Rajab,"WalaikumAssalam warahmatullahi wabarakatuh,   Akhi how will you forbid an evil you're not certain about it? You yourself said you didn't see it and you don't know exactly what they are showing! so why don't you wait until you become certain and then when there's something wrong you can give your advice inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   I don't know, I didn't hear it, but it's true that women in Jannah are more beautiful than Al Hoor Al ain."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   You lower your gaze in a way that you don't commit a sin, sometimes it maybe literally, other times it could be looking around."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   If you don't have enough time to do ghusl then this prayer is not mandatory. All what I can say: Go home, have a shower and pray."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   These books have many authentic ahadith and many weak ahadith as well. So we can't take these books for granted regardless of the author. Maybe they had a sincere intention and they'll be rewarded for that inshallah. But they won't be greater than the books of great schoalrs like Bukhari, Muslim and others.  The Muslim should take what's right and correct regardless of the person himself.   I'm not sure about the story of Imam Abu Hanifa Rahimahullah. It could be true and it could be fake. It's not part of our religion, if it's true then it's a sign of the righteousness of this Imam that's all.  But I'm pretty sure that the other story is false. Whatever this person did it won't be greater than what the companions or other scholars did yet we never heard them saying that the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam shook their hands!!"
Isam Rajab,"Asalamualyakum, Is it permissible to show a video recording which has only women in it and no music to an audience of only women?"
Isam Rajab,"By the time the son marries a woman, his father become forbidden for her for ever. So when his son dies, whether during Idda or afterwards, it's the same."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum,  When there is a proposal for a girl or for a boy, their families try to match their stars to see if their relationship going to workout.   Is it okay to match the starts ??? Does it come under astrology ???   Asalam o alikum"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It depends on your situation, for some people, they need to make hijra to America becasue that's where they could practice Islam, for other people they may need to make hijra from America because they can't practice Islam here and they can practice Islam elsewhere."
Isam Rajab,What is the surah in the quran which is considered the heaert of the Quran?
Isam Rajab,"You're created to worship AlMighty god, that's why you're created. If you don't then you'll go to hell. I believe it's very clear."
Isam Rajab,salam.. is Oral sex haram? provide examples please.. thanks
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes it's a relative issue, what may be extravagance to someone may not be so to another one. In general extravagance is what's spend on the disobedience to Allah Subhanahu Wata'la even if it was a small amount. Our it's what exceeded the avarage which is not needed. And again the average varies from a person to another.   If someone earns $300 yet he spends $500 on his shoes then he's not extravagant but he's insaine."
Isam Rajab,"Yes, the order in the Aya is clear to lower your gaze and safegueard your private part. Also, the Messenger Sallallahu aliahi wasallam saw his cousin looking at a women, so he turned his face away."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes, because this is the Sunnah in prayer, the only difference I know is when you're praying in front of the Ka'bah and you still look to the place where you'll prostrte on, so unless there's an evidence to say you look to your hands you need to keep looking to the place of your prostration."
Isam Rajab,"I don't recommend calling or labeling ourselves any name but muslims. When Imam Malik rahimahullah was asked about the true people of Ahl Assuna waljama he said: &quot;They are those who don't have any extra name&quot;! Unfortunately, many people think if they labled themselves or gave themselves names it'll be enough! What counts is actions not titles."
Isam Rajab,"I'm not sure. Why she's living there? She lives in a place there's no one single good place to work in?    If she's not married, I advise her to find a husband who could provide for her."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, first you need to know why they are putting these beverages in look like alchool bottles or glasses? If it's not intended then there's nothing wrong with it and you can't prevent them from that because the issue is not the shape of the beverage the issue is what's that beverage? Sometimes people try to condemn something while it's not evil. Once you make sure that they did it copying the kuffar then you can advise them that we can't imitate them and it's forbidden, if they didn't listen after you reminded them then you can leave them while they're doing this and you don't join them."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh, If he hanged it to remember it then it should be permissible because it's a type of reminding himself with a good thing and Allah says in the Quran {Remind for rememberence is helpful for believers} so this should be the same and it's permissible. The dua' should not be hanged as a decoration, that's not why we have the dua', the dua' is to be said and remembered so it's not recommended to be hanged as a decoration. If it's done then it's disliked but it's not haram."
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu alaykum warahmtuallahi wabarkatuh,  Sometimes when praying in the masjid with elders they read the Qur'an aloud, loud for the people standing beside them to hear them and it can be distracting. How do i tell them to keep their voices down? or am i not allowed to tell them that?"
Isam Rajab,I'm sorry but your question still seems unlcear to me!
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   There are always offers for interest free 0% you should go for it. Even the dealership that says we don't give 0% they still work with you to eliminate it. That's what I did and that's what I advise you to do."
Isam Rajab,Aalaam u Alaikum  Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakathoo  when doing mas'ah (wiping) over the socks for wudhu how does one exactly wipe over them? does one wipe over them one at a time starting with the right and then the left or does one wipe over them at the same time with right and left hands together?  May Allah reward you.  Wasalaam.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If it's without interest then yes it's permissible."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, You're supposed to look at your position of sujud. There are few ahadith mentioned in this regard."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   We advised ISNA not to take that decision when we met with their president last year but they won't listen. Last year was a great lesson that we can't rely on mere calculations. They said it's impossible for the moon to be sighted yet it was seen and they announced the Eid and they changed their statement and that was just last year! Alhamdulillah, here in Houston all the shuyoukh with no exception agreed to discard this opinion. However, in your case, you go with what people do. Isna's opinion has some basis which is weak but it's still better than dividing the community, so if your community is going with isna then go with them."
Isam Rajab,Salamualaikum  is it true that two women/two men who are just friends are not allowed to sleep in the same bed and/or share the same blanket?
Isam Rajab,No! Muslims will fight alongside the Christians against another enemy. This battle is different from the battle with the Jews.
Isam Rajab,"I still don't get the question but regarding vinegar, if it was transformed from alcohol by itself then it's halal but if it's the work of a man then you can't drink it."
Isam Rajab,"Joking is not a legitimate excuse for this action. Also, not every action could be valid for Dawah. We have lots of methods and I don't see this as one of them. So you should be careful and not do this."
Isam Rajab,Yes definately you'll get more reward by using siwak because it's sunnah. There's a hadeeth but it's not authentic it says a prayer with siwak is 70 times better than a prayer without siwak.   There are two narrations for the hadeeth about using siwak one says after the wudu and another says before the prayer so it's up to you.
Isam Rajab,"as salam aliekum Imaam  What if a person seeks Islamic knowledge with the intention of teaching his people, is this permitted?  How can we make sure our intentions are pure?"
Isam Rajab,"I didn't imply anything, whoever compares Allah Subhanahu Wata'la to his creation is wrong and committing a sin because Allah Subhanahu Wata'la is the creator and He's unlike His creation. Allah says in the Quran in more than one place: { The most merciful rose over His throne}.  So if you're going to ask how Allah Subhanahu Wata'la rose over His throne then I'm afraid that I may take another procedure. Imam Malik Rahimahullah kicked out the one who asked in his session how Allah rose over His throne."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam o alikum,  Is it true that there will be an Imam, named Mahdee, will appear at the end of this world?  Can you please explain in detail about him and also is it mention anywhere in the Quran or Hadeeth about him? If yes, where?   Asalam o alikum wr wb"
Isam Rajab,Can i give my dad a birthday present ?   jzk
Isam Rajab,"WaalaikumuSallam Warahmatullah,   Al-Bait almamoor is built over the Ka'ba exactly, it's in the seventh heaven, every day seventy thousand angel visit it. The Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam saw Ibrahim Peace be upon him during the trip of Isra and Miraj leaning on it.   There's no evidence that the soul is taken there after death. If it's a believer's soul then it'll reach the seventh heaven but then it'll be returned to the grave and If it's a disbeliever's soul then it'll be rejected from the first heaven."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, I pray to Allah Subhanahu Wata'la to bless your marriage and to grant you the righteous offspring.   There are many things that could help, but I can summerize few points that I believe it'll help you inshallah: 1- Love and Mercy: Love only is not enough in marriage. There has to be mercy from you to her and from her to you. 2- Communication: If there's a problem to happen (And there's no marriage without problems) try to talk about it and discuss it with her. Many people involve others while their spouse is the last one to know about the problem! 3- Give her as much as you expect from her to give you. We tend to remember our rights but we forget our obligations. 4- Don't force her to change herself. You are two different people. So try to respect the differences between you and her, as long as the difference doesn't displease Allah Subhanahu Wata'la then it's a good thing.  As I said, there are many things to be said, but I believe what I mentioned is sufficient inshallah. Patience is MUST in every successful marriage."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   The plural in the word Jahadoo is not for the act itself (Object) but it's for the people (Subject). That doesn't mean jihad is only one type because definately jihad is many types. Of it the struggle with oneself to fight the whims and desires that are against Islam, of it fighting the enemies who attack muslims and do injustice and of it saying the truthful word before an unjust ruler which is the greatest jihad as the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   The Prophet Sallallahualihai wasallam used to pray for the guidance for the disbelievers whenever he's asked to do dua against them like when Abu Huraira asked him to pray against his tribe but he prayed for them and also the tribe of Hawazen south of Mecca.   However, the Prophet Sallallahualiahi wasallam also cursed specific people from the disbelievers in Mecca and they were all killed in the battle of Badr. Also he prayed against few tribes that killed his companions.   So it's permissible to pray against specific people if they transgressed against muslims. and it's also permissible to say what the Quran said in general about the wrong doers and the likes of them."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, No, he has to lead you and you should stand behind him not next to him."
Isam Rajab,"There's a hadeeth which is not authentic says that whoever doesn't fast without an excuse, it wont be sufficient for him to fast the entire year. But as I said, it's not authentic. We know that Allah subhanahu wata'la is merciful, so if somebody did it and asked for forgiveness he'll be forgiven inshallah."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahamtuallahi Wabarakatuh,   Athkar shouldn't be delayed unless there's a reason like traveling when you say the Athkar after Isha. Because the Athkar are attached to the prayer, The Prophet Sallallahualaihi wasallam said: When you finish prayer you say so and so. But if you don't say, that means you didn't fulfill the condition."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   As long as she's able to fast, then she has to fast, if she has to make up 6 years of fasting then this may take 10 years or so, that's fine, she could do that. If she can't do it, then she can pay to feed the poor people instead. Allah says in the Quran {Fear(Obey) Allah as much as you can}, so she doesn't move from fasting to paying unless she's unable to fast."
Isam Rajab,"bismillaahir rahmaanir raheem  i teach english as a foriegn language in the middle east. the country in which i live in isnt a strict islaamic country. so the institutes which teach english tends to be mixed (boys and girls). i have now found a decent institute where the people who work there dont let just anyone enroll for a course. they want me to teach and promised me to only put girls in my class who would wear islamic dress and that they would divide the class having girls sit at the back and guys at the front. MY problem is the fact that as a teacher, teaching involves lots of eye contact and this is why i tend not to work in such institutions... but in this country this is all that is available. PLEASE ADVISE."
Isam Rajab,"Imam ibn Al Qaiem rahimahullah described the women of Paradiese accurately in his poem. I'm not comfortable mentioning the details, however, you could read the interpretation of aya 33 of surat Annaba in the 30th juz. It's right that not only the martyrs get them, but they get more than others. The reward of women is different, because their nature is different. Inshallah this is something I may mention in details later on."
Isam Rajab,"If you cause a harm to another Muslim, You have to let them forgive you. Let's say someone stole $100 from a man, after sometime he repented and asked forgiveness 1000 times, he has to return the money back, or that man has to forgive him. Now we're not asked to question the intention whether this person means it or not. Only Allah  judges people for their intentions. It's always recommended to appologize if we did something offended others, especially if that'll make them feel better, that's the sunnah of the Messenger sallalahu alaihi wasallam, he appologized to many people! Since we're human beings, we have to err, otherwise, we wont be humans! And since we make mistakes, we have to correct them, and sometimes, the correction has to be by appologizing."
Isam Rajab,There are some narrations from the companions of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam and their successors that they accepted this type of gifts and that entails the permissibility of purchasing them so it's permissible but I don't recommend it since it was made for a Christian religious celebration which we don't approve in Islam.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Yes you can intervene in this situation. You need to know first why he's doing this? What's not valid to you could be valid to him.  You should help anyway you can because that's the duty of a Muslim upon other Muslims."
Isam Rajab,"No they will not. That depends on the situation. Scholars agreed on that. At the time of Omar may Allah be pleased with him, the second caliph, there was a poverty in Madinah and some people stole due to their extreme need yet he didn't cut them. It's the role of the ruler to provide the means before he enforces punishments."
Isam Rajab,"assalamu alaikum  i wanted to ask 2 questions about pain relief during labour:  i) many sisters approach the subject of an &quot;epidural&quot; as if it is taboo, haram or definately disliked; i assume that they do this on the grounds that they think it is better for someone to endure the pain than take medication. however, such sisters find no qualms using other forms of pain relief during labour (but often less effective) such as &quot;gas and air&quot;. an epidural can mean that a sister feels little-no pain during a labour, or that she still feels intense pain but it is less than what it could be, or that she will have periods of intense pain and periods where the pain is minimal. some say that this is no different than taking anaesthetic when you have a dental operation (no one will refuse that).  what is the islamic ruling on taking an epidural?  ii) what is the ruling on entonox (gas and air)? i have heard muslim doctors say that they think this may be haram as it may be an intoxicant as it causes a woman to hallucinate during the labour. this is the preferred pain relief method for most sisters i believe.  jazakAllah khair"
Isam Rajab,"Salamualaykum,   We know that our beloved Prophet (sas) learned the verses of the Qur'an via Angel Gibrael but how was the message sent to the other Prophets (peace be upon them), like Noah (as). I was reading a book about the Prophets and it just said that it was revealed to them...but how ? And if it is something that we just don't know then thats ok.   jzk"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Yes, it has the same ruling. All scholars agreed on that because the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam forbade both eating and drinking. The issue is not to eat or drink, but the issue is if it's permissible to use them or not? Many scholars said it's forbidden to even use them and that's the strong opinion."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   As long as the person is alive and his soul didn't depart his body then his repentance is accepted as the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam mentioned so do his or her good deeds. Illness comes and goes and many people die while they didn't have diseases and many sick people live a long life. Allah Subhanahu Wata'la may accept the deeds from some people and may reject the deeds of others. As long as these deeds are pleasing Allah Subhanahu Wata'la and done sincerely for His sake then it will be accepted regardless of the condition of the person."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   In general, what was permissible in this life will be also permissible in paradise and what was prohibited here in this life will be also prohibited in paradise. That's the general rule. So based on that women won't be showing their adorment in front of stranger men. I'm not sure what do you mean by meeting freely without restriction. Definately Muslims will be able to meet with prophets and companions but in an appropriate way. If these are young girls then it's a wrong idea to go that deep in this matter from the beginning! You're talking about future things that no one will guarantee if they'll happen to him or not. Allah Subhanahu Wata'la promised His servants with great things if they obeyed Him and He gave some examples but we didn't say any of this in our life so it's better to be kept until we meet Him inshallah. Allah Subhanahu Wata'la will give each person what he desires in paradise. So if women needed men then Allah Subhanahu Wata'la would've promised them men as well just like the men who were promised the purified women, but since women are not promised so that means there will be other things that'll please them based on their nature and their creation."
Isam Rajab,"Will you make duaa for my Father's health?  As a daughter what shall I often recite for My father's health , that Allaah may grant him Shifa'a from all of his ailments and protect him. My mother and I are very depressed when we see NO improvments in him ,after we make Dua'a to Allaah. It's greatly letting us down,,"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi wabarakatuh,   A step mother can never replace the real mother. Yet she's still an old woman has to be respected since she's the wife of the father and this is a type of being dutiful to the father."
Isam Rajab,"Salamun Alaykum wa Rahmatullah,  Dear Shaik,   I wanted to ask you If you know the elmul magamat (the mealodonic tones) in recitation of Quran. Such in the cases of the egyptian shaiks like shaik Abdul Basit, Sidiq Minshawi, Shaik Mustafa Ismael, Shaik Ghalwash.  The magams like: magamal bayati, magamal suyuti, magamal hejaz.  And if you teach them.  Wa Salamun Alaykum"
Isam Rajab,"Assalamu alaykum warahmatullah,  I know that Allah comes down to the lowest heaven in the last part of the night (last 1/3 of the night)- so does that mean if i wake up 30mins before fajr starts, i can pray tahajjat?  Also, what is the tahajjat salah- sunnah or nafl? (so i know what i am praying when i make my intention for the prayer).  Jazzak Allah khier for your time and help."
Isam Rajab,Asalamu alaykum  What does Islam say about transgendered people? Does a trangendered 'male' or 'female' allowed to marry? etc
Isam Rajab,"salam sheikh,  if someone draws conclusions about you that are not true (eg ur race or ur gender or ur age) and u didnt do anything to lead them to believe it it was just their assumption, then they address u based on their assumption, is it haram or wrong for u not to correct that assumption, knowing that if u dont they will keep believin it about u?"
Isam Rajab,"Even if students at school look at her that's still not permanent and she's not supposed to encourage them and tell them go ahead here I am look at me, while when she puts her picture then they can look permanently and gaze at her so she can't do that."
Isam Rajab,"salamualykum,  my uncle name is Abdul Hadi, can we call them only Hadi?  they says we have to call him by his full name? people whose name starts with Abdul,can not we just call them in short by their second nameas of Hadi, instead of full name ,Abdul Hadi, is their any sin in doing that?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes it's permissible especially if you believe the need is dire in those coutnries where you're donating. Otherwise, it's recommended to be sacrificied in your own town."
Isam Rajab,"Asalam Alaikum ya shiek, inshaAllah you are in the best of health, I want to know a) is there such thing as depression in islam, can you be depressed and still Muslim?Can you think thoughts of suicide, plan it , feel hopeless and sad all the time yet still believe in Allah? b) how does Allah view and judge a depressed person? Is depression a disease like the western psychologists say that a depressed person can NOT help themselves and their main hope is drugs. They say they have can't make themsleves happy again , they can't help themselves, they have a chemical imbalance that's making them like this.There are many views ofcourse but this is the main one that i know.Baisically the question is , is depression something that is within a person's control or not like a disease.Thus how would Allah judge a depressed person not praying sometimes, in their times of complete hopelessness. c) Islam, the religion of bringing peace through submission to God Alone. Islam is the answer, yet many muslim friends of mine are severly depressed. How can Islam help? ( Most important question) Any thoughts on this topic would be really beneficial.I've heard that when you are afflicted by a trial , shaytan hurts you by making it seem that there is no one of knowledge to help you.He has done this for many years to me and I need answers. Please ya sheikh, answer to your best ability and may Allah reward you the highest reward for helping many muslims afflicted with this."
Isam Rajab,"as-salamu alaykum,   I know that as adult male muslim I am mahram for my own brother's/sister's daughter.. but am I also mahram for my WIFE's brother's/sister's daughter??  barakallah feekum"
Isam Rajab,"Actually I'm not aware of that but it should be a good step inshallah. Yes having four witnesses is a condition. Allah clearly mentioned that in the Quran in Surat Annur in the first few ayat of the Surah. Or if the person admitted himself that he did it then also he should be punished. I think you may be asking about other evidences like forensic evidence other than the witnesses. If that's the case then there are few researches written now about this issue, Islam doesn't contradict science but the wintesses should not be replaced also."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If you believe your donation will help the cause of Dawah then yes you can donate to them even if they have this wrong thing. You're able to tell them I want the money to be paid to this specific thing. Apparently they have many good things that you can spend on and donate to."
Isam Rajab,"If you say that rain came because of the clouds and you ignore the power of Allah Subhanahu Wata'la then it's shirk, but when you say that this what may happen as they say (forcast) then there's nothing wrong with it. If someone said the man was killed because the knife was sharp he's not considered mushrik! Everyone knows that Allah Subhanahu Wata'la who took his soul.   In Islam we don't have viewpoint. viewpoint means something could be right or wrong. Islam is always correct whether we knew the ruling or not. So we have in Islam verdicts and rulings not viewpoints."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Lot's of what your sister said is true. It's not an easy thing to do. That's why I don't encourage a sister to wear it unless she's willing to sacrifice because it's a strong Jihad.    Inshallah if you decided to go on and wear it then remember that Allah will be with you inshallah and yes he'll protect you. People here in America change their opinions easily, what was bad in 70s is not bad anymore now. People are doing grave sins openly without condemnation, so why when a Muslimah wants to come close to Allah she can't do that?    Niqaab could be a strong method of Dawah inshallah, when people see you they'll start asking questions and you could educate them about Islam."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Maybe you're refering to the battle of Camel where Aisha Radiallahu Anha went along with Azzubair and Talha Radiallahu Anhum with lots of Muslims and eventually fought Ali Radiallahu Anh. That was not a personal problem between Ali and Aisha Radiallahu Anhum and yes the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam predicted that Aisha Radiallahu Anha would go but he didn't say she'll have problems with Ali."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikumussalam,   If every team pays a specific fee and the winner gets all that money then it's forbidden because it's type of gambling.    But if you participate free and you get a prize then it's ok."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Not as I know, I remember there was an opinion saying she should not, but I don't really recall an authentic evidence."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   There are two types of differences in Tafsir:   1- difference of variation: Similar meaning with different words. 2- difference of contradition: different meaning totally.   Most of differences in Tafsir among the scholars of the first type. And this is the case here. They all give similar meanings. When you follow the Quran and Sunnah then you're following Islam and Islam is the covenant of Allah because it's his religion."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   NO it's not sufficient to rub his body with cloth because this is mash (wiping) while he has to do ghusl and the water has to touch his body directly. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam used to perform ghusl with almost half a galon of water and I don't imgaine someone doesn't have that water!  If you don't have enough water then you use the water and perform tayammum."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Imam Ashafie Rahimahullah mentioned 6 things you won't get knowledge without them: Intellegence, Caring about the knowledge, hard working and striving, proper means, the company of a teacher and finally you need long time. These are essential things Imam Ashafie Rahimahullah listed.   Nowadays I would tell you if you could find a true teacher then that's the most important thing. You need a teacher that teaches basics and principles before jumping to the other issues.   After high school you need to register in one of the official Islamic Institutions if you wanted to become a student of knowledge."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   It's good to remind these gatherings with the Sunnah of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam when someone dies, He asked to pray for him because that's what will help him. Scholars differed on whether reciting the Quran for the deceased will help him or not. But to have a gathering on a specific day to do that is an innovation. Maybe the first time you need to sit with them not to share their innovation but to remind them or to ask them if they want to help the deceased or they only want to do something they like? Then you could produce to them the alternative. Sometimes in these gatherings the people of the deceased make food while the Sunnah is that the people make food for the family of the deceased as the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said when his cusin Ja'far Radiallahu Anh was martyred. May Allah protect all of us from innovations."
Isam Rajab,"Al-Salamu Alaikum:  According to Al-Qurtubi's tafsir of 4:140, he states:   al-Qurtubi (may Allaah have mercy on him)said: “then sit not with them, until they engage in a talk other than that” means, other than kufr. “(but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them” this indicates that it is obligatory to avoid keeping company with sinners if they openly commit evil, because the one who does not avoid them is approving of their actions, and approving of kufr is kufr. Allaah says: “(but if you stayed with them) certainly in that case you would be like them” so everyone who sits in a sinful gathering and does not denounce them, shares the burden of sin equally with them.   He should denounce them if they speak of sin and commit sin. If he is not able to denounce them then he should get up and leave, so that he will not be one of those mentioned in this verse.    It was narrated that ‘Umar ibn ‘Abd al-‘Azeez (may Allaah be pleased with him) caught some people who were drinking alcohol, and it was said to him that one of those who were present was fasting. He had him beaten in order to discipline him, and he recited this verse: “certainly in that case you would be like them” i.e., approving of sin is also sin.   End quote from Tafseer al-Qurtubi (5/418)   My question is: does this include what the kuffaar say regarding Allah and His Messengers (i.e. falsehood/lies/slander/swearing, etc.), also, when they say such things as 'Isa (Jesus) is the son of god (astagfirullah), is this taken under the context of mockery and therefore we must leave them?  salam wa jazakallah"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Of the group who was with Ali Radiallahu Anh many companions and successors, that doesn't mean they're Shia! That's a lie. At that time of fighting, Ali Radiallahu Anh was correct, but that doesn't mean whatever we innovate or add to the religion is correct just because we can say we used to follow Ali Radiallahu Anh. After the assassination of Ali Radiallahu Anh there was a small group started claiming that Ali Radiallahu Anh didn't die, then they started saying that Ali Radiallahu Anh was more worthy to be the caliph instead of Abu Bakr and Omar but they didn't have proof for that so they said the Quran was changed and the ayat the proof Ali should be the caliph after the prophet sallallahualaihi wasallam are removed. Thus - they say- all companions did apostate except few of them and so on... I can't really summerize the history in one answer, I was looking for a good book in english or a tranlsated book to english but I didn't find any, sh. Ihsan Ilahi Thahir Rahimahullah wrote excellent books about them."
Isam Rajab,"Salaamu3laykum.  My friend took out a loan from a bank to buy a car and she is involved in interest now.  I told her that it was haraam and she told me she did not know that paying interest was haraam...she thought that only charging interest was haraam. Now she has bought the car and I told her to stop paying and let the bank repossess it.  But, she says that it will really mess up her credit and it will be difficult since she lives on her own and supports herself. She says that since she did not know, then she has no choice but to make the payments.    My question is: Should she stop making payments and let the bank repossess the car even if it will mess up her credit?  JazaakAllah khayr."
Isam Rajab,"Assalaamu alaikum,  A sister once brought up that a mother-in-law should to some degree, cover in front of her son-in-law.  She mentioned that the ayah that talks about covering doesnt mention this relationship, so that is why this is the case.  Could you please elaborate on this?  JazakAllaahu khair."
Isam Rajab,"Waalaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah, It's recommended to have a time allows you to know the lady and she knows you. After that, the process is simple, you bring the witnesses and you do the contract then you're married. Then you invite people for a Walimah.   Marriage in Islam is very easy. If you read about the marriages happened at the time of the Messenger Sallallahualiah wasallam you'll notice that they're made quickly and smoothly without any complications.   Honeymoon is not from the Sunnah. All the Marriage should be a honeymoon not the first few days."
Isam Rajab,"If someone prayed 3 Rak'ah insted of 2 in Subh or Duha or any other prayer, it won't matter what intention he has because it won't be accpeted. Allah Subhanahu Wata'la sent Muhammad Sallallahualaihi wasallam to teach us how to worship Allah correctly, that's why the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam said: &quot;Pray like you see me praying&quot; and he said also: &quot;Perform Hajj like I do&quot; He didn't tell everybody to do whatever they want as long as their intention is correct!   &quot;Every innovation is misguidance and every misguidance leads to hellfire&quot;. So there's no good innovation and bad innovation. Every innovation leads eventually to hellfire as it was reported by Aisha Radiallahu Anha from the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam: &quot;Whoever innovated something in our religion it'll be rejected&quot;."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, Unfortunately, I havent heard such a narration."
Isam Rajab,"What does one do if they are worried all the time. They feel like they may loose close family members to death or that something bad may happen in the future. What do u do if this type of anxiety leads to sleeplessness or sometimes...even sleeping too much on purpose so you wont have to think about things that worry them ? I know that we should remember death, and that it keeps things in perspective...but to what extent ? Am I overly anxious ? A kufar psychologist would say yes obviously...but what would you say ?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Even if the taxi driver has to accept a drunk man or half naked woman, he didn't ask them to drin, he didn't help them to become half naked so he's not doing something wrong and it's permissible for him to work as a taxi driver. If there's a woman alone in the cab then the driver can refrain from letting her in by just keeping driving. That doesn't make his job forbidden. Allah says {Fear Allah as much as you could} that's all what he should do."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   In general yes it's permissible.  But sometimes they recite lots of things on the food and that's why it's kosher and thus you have many other types of food like candies and bread yet it's kosher! So if you know what they say and you know it's haram then you don't eat it. But if you don't know then you can eat it. I'm trying to know what they say exactly because they have also several levels like (k), (U) and so on, yet you don't have to investigate. So I could tell you so far I don't see any problem with it so it should be permissible."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, And chaperone is?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Allah says in the Quran 41:31 {Therein you shall have (all) that your inner-selves desire, and therein you shall have (all) for which you ask for}  I think this ayah is clear enough and it answers your question. Whatever you wish, you'll get it inshallah in Jannah.   If both spouses were believers then they'll be together in Jannah."
Isam Rajab,"Dear Shaykh,  Is it permissible for a group of sisters travelling 100 miles away without a mahram if they had security and some of the sisters have their brothers but not all of them? jazakalla"
Isam Rajab,"Yes you can because your intention is not to recite the Quran &quot;although you're doing this anyway&quot; but your intention is to protect yourself so you could read surat al ikhlas, ayat al kursi and so on."
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu alaykum  What does Islam say about men/women becoming nurses seeing as some of the job requires tending to old people and cleaning them, they can be of opposite sex.  Jizakallah khair in advance"
Isam Rajab,"Is it permissable/prohibated to utilise money given as sadaqah, lillaah, zakaat etc with the intention of putting it back. (1) Utilising because of a urgent need or (2)using it generally with the intention to put it back.  Would this be regarded as consuming wealth unlawfully as it has been given by person(s) and their idea/intention/wish is, for it to be given to a the poor and others entitled to it.  If it is prohibited - is their a specific form of tawbah that the person has to make."
Isam Rajab,"He's not supposed to hit someone like his uncle even if his uncle hit him but he definitely can report him or file a complaint against him. A person is not blamed to defend himself, we all fall in this sometimes but we should not forget that we're muslims and we have our religion controls us. May Allah make it easy for this brother and for everybody."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Put your hand on your head and say Bismillah twice then say: Authu Bi'izzatillahi Waqudratih min sharri ma ajidu Wauhathir. 7 times. بسم الله بسم الله أعوذ بعزة الله وقدرته من شر ما أجد وأحاذر   Also say: Allahumma Rabbannas Athhib Alba's Ishfi Wa'antashafi La shifa' Illa Shifau'k. Shifa'n La Yughadiru Saqama. اللهم رب الناس أذهب الباس اشف وأنت الشافي لا شفاء إلا شفاؤك شفاء لا يغادر سقما   It's better to pray for yourself and be certain of Allah's response."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   If you believe touching the wife doesn't break your wudu then it doesn't. If the wife believes the opposite then this touching will break her wudu. So the same act will result differently on the husband and the wife. The correct opinion of Imam Ashafie Rahimahullah is that touching the wife doesn't break the Wudu because of the authentic hadith were the Messenger Sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to kiss his wives before he leaves. And the Imam said whenever the hadith is authentic then this is my mathhab."
Isam Rajab,If he didn't see the gift then don't give it to him. That's better based on the hadith: &quot;Leave what you suspect to what you don't suspect&quot;. If he already saw it then you could give it to him but don't encourage him to play with it. Even if he played with it there's no harm inshallah because it could be similar to the doll that Aisha Radiallahu Anha used to play with.
Isam Rajab,"They can, but it's better to pay off their debt first. Paying off the debt is Obligatory, while Sadaqa is recommended, so we should start with what's obligatory."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   No that's not true, otherwise we have to fold all the Masjid carpets!"
Isam Rajab,"How should we look at a woman's duty to her children's minute-to-minute upbringing? I thought that arab children were often sent to wet-nurses to be raised by others who would teach them good manners, etc. Is this only pre-islam? We hear a lot that a woman's main role is in caring for her children. There is a culture of almost looking down on women who do not stay at home with their kids to take care of them and instead leave them with their inlaws or daycare etc for several hours during the day. However, we still have a community need for muslimah's to take certain roles like teaching, psychology, medicine, etc and often the muslimahs themselves have a desire to use their skill or knowledge.   I would think that leaving a child with the child's grandparents or another trustworthy muslim (i.e. daycare, nanny etc) for the daytime hours would be similar or in some cases better than sending the child to live with a wet nurse. Is my understanding of history incorrect? What is the correct understanding of this?"
Isam Rajab,Asalamu alaykum  Why do people say wajib and fardh means different things when they both mean obligatory. For example people might say niqaab is wajib and not fardh....is there a difference?
Isam Rajab,"As salamu alaykum yaa sheykh a revert sister asked me, whether the women in paradise get me of paradise also like the men in paradise get hoorul a3yn.  she said she heard it on a tape by Zakir, Please make this clear to me so i can explain it to her inshaallah barakAllaahu feeka"
Isam Rajab,"we're confused too   yet you should do all three things! obey, overthrow and be patient! if they order you to obey Allah, you can't say no! just becasue they're bad! when they ask you to disobey Allah, you say no! and in general, you have to be patient since this is the advice of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam to his companions. so it's difficult to generalize, some rulers are better than others, some people are different than others! so you have to be wise always inshallah"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   All scholars agreed that pre seminal fluids are impure. But they differed on the semen itself since it's the origion of the human being. Imam Abu Hanifa and Imam Malik said it's impure as well. Imam Ashafie and Imam Ahmad said it's pure. Each group has evidences yet the stronger opinion is that it's not impure."
Isam Rajab,"AOA  When someone files for divorce through American legal system, does this count as 1 divorce or 3 divorce.  At what point does Halala become necessary.  Their are theses people who have been divorced for over 2 years, and now they say they have done nikah again are married again.  They say that they had only divorced 1 time, that is why they do not need  halala?  I am confused."
Isam Rajab,"Aswbthu,  I am talking to a sister right now with the intention of marraige Insha'Allah.  She is more conservative then her family Masha'Allah, but her family wants a big Pakistani wedding with lots of things suchas the mehdnhi, mayoo, nikka, waleema, all on different events. she said that her sister's wedding was like 70k to 100k she said she can convince her family to drop to 50k, anyways.  She says that her family is coming at the angle that they care about the daughter so they want to do everything they can.. to make sure her new beginnning is good so this is their way of people not saying bad things about the daughter, meaning that by throwing a big function they show that they care about her daughter ...i would like to have a simple wedding insh. The sister ...said that when she has her kids it will be different, but when it comes to this wedding with her parents she feels that it is out of her control. My question is should i go along with this marriage because the sister is pious and just go through with it or should i look for another sister?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If your job doesn't involve haram then there's no problem in taking that job. There are people who work as software developers in companies that don't have 100% investments but their job itself is not haram. There are people who run the electricity or phone cables or so for non halal companies yet they themselves are not doing something haram.   And yes there are many 100% halal jobs but the problem with some people is that they only think of what's haram and they don't see the alternatives."
Isam Rajab,"Salaam    Is jihad fardh ayn upon us all? I understood that when the Muslims are attacked it is responsibility of the closest country to come to their aid, and then the next closest and so on, until the responsibility reaches the whole world.     What is the responsibility of the scholars in this? Shouldn抰 the scholars be calling the ummah to unite to repel this oppression?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes he's considered stealing their money and committing one of the major sins. The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam clearly said that the judgment of a ruler doesn't make what's unlawful lawful."
Isam Rajab,"It's better to avoid it. Although we give up some privacy when we register in a forum or other service online, yet we might prefer keeping our actions hidden from others. So I advise you not to do it especially if you don't like others to do the same to you! And the real muslim is the one who treats others like he loves to be treated."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   The hadith is in Sahih Muslim."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   If you have a property that you rent then you pay the Zakat on the income you get from that property not the value of the property itself."
Isam Rajab,"My question is does the Imam have to stay still facing the qiblah when making Athan? Sometimes when my father is making Athan he's moving around like fixing the Sijadah while he's making Athan, so I wanted to know if the Imam has to stay stll facing the Kiblah."
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu alaykum  All creatures are God's children, and those dearest to God are the ones who treat His children kindly.  (Baihaqi).  What is meant by 'God's children'?"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, The saying of the husband is sufficient so if he said that he divorced his wife then they're divorced. But some scholars recommended having two witnesses. If a wife claims that her husband divorced her then she needs an evidence."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes, everything has a reason but we can't comprehend this reason everytime, maybe sometimes but not everytime. We're too weak and too ignorant to rationalize the actions of Allah Subhanahuwata'la.   your child who's only 8 or 10 or even more may not be able to comprehend your action and we're all creatures, so more likely we won't comprehend the reason behind the creator's actions."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Because that's what the Messenger Sallallahualaihi Wasallam told us to say. Some scholars tried to look for the wisdom behind that and they say that this call for prayer can't be answered except by the will of Allah Subhanahu Wata'la."
Isam Rajab,"There's no such hadeeth &quot;Follow the laws of whichever the land you are staying in&quot;. What if the law of the land tells you to fornicate? or drink alcohol every friday night, are you going to do it?   There are few Islamic organizations trying to find solutions for interest. So I advise you to talk to one of them and see how could they help you."
Isam Rajab,Jazakallah khair Abu Ilyaas for this clarification.   I didn't mean to offend you in anyway whatsoever. But if that's how you feel then I apologize.
Isam Rajab,"Mental disorders could happen due to different causes not necessarly Jinn. Some types could be treated by medicine and other types could be because of Jinn possession. At the time of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam there was a woman who brought her son to the Messenger sallahu alaihi wasallam. So the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam talked to the jinn inside the boy and said: &quot;Get out the enemy of Allah, I'm the Messenger of Allah&quot; and then told his mother to meet him again after they return. When they returned he saw the woman and asked her about her son and she said: &quot;He's totally fine&quot;. [narrated by Ahmad] Sometimes people think that any disorder is caused by Jinn and that's not true. It's always recommended to protect yourself by reciting the Quran and saying the Thikr after the prayer, when you wake up and when you go to sleep. Yet, if something happened you should know exactly what is it before you think it's Jinn!"
Isam Rajab,"Asalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu  Recently I got engaged Alhumdulillah, and at the engagement, the father of the brother, asked me if I agreed, and I said yes, and he asked his son, and he said yes, and my father was there as well, and ofcourse he was not against it. There were 2 witnesses present ( My brother, and the father of the brother) ... and the prophet said, 3 things that are taken seriously even if it is joking, one of them is marriage... so did our nikah happen?  :/"
Isam Rajab,do my uncle's wives have to cover from me? do they have to observe nikab or hijab?
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes it could. Ibn Al Qayim Rahimahullah mentioned few good things about it in one of his books: &quot;Ighathatullahfan min Masa'id Ashaytan&quot;."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   Listening to the tape is good but it's not sufficient. The tape doesn't have the intention you have! Read from the Quran, make lots of mistakes, you'll get the reward twice inshallah. Few weeks later, you'll be able to eliminate these mistakes.  For now, you could turn on the tape and recite with it."
Isam Rajab,Option one seems better since you didn't start your journy on Friday and also you're traveling for a valid cause so even if you miss friday that's permissible. The only case it becomes prohibited when you travel with the intention of missing the Friday prayer.
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam Warahmatullahi Wabarakatuh,   I don't know this hadith."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   As long as he knows how to pray then it's permissible. During the time of the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam there was an Imam who was 7 years old only but he memorized more than the rest so he was their Imam."
Isam Rajab,"Salaam  I performed umrah and forgot that I had not cut my hair. I then continued to live as if I was not in a state of ihram, cutting my nails, applying perfume etc for several days, before I remembered and realised I hadn't cut my hair and thus hadn't come out of ihram. What must I do?"
Isam Rajab,"assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakateh  May Allah reward you with the best of rewards. amin. Could you please tell me  1. where I can find following hadith,  2. what is the meaning and  3. what is the verdict on it?   The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: 揙bedience is only with regard to that which is right and proper.? 4. What is exactly the meaning of ma'ruf?  jazakallah."
Isam Rajab,"It has been said there is an increase in the divorce rate amongst Muslims who reside in the West, would you agree?  As an imam, what would you say are main reasons for divorce amongst Muslims in the West and how can it be avoided?  What would your advice be to both divorced men and women when they want to try for marriage again?  was-salam."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   She only has to be chaste and of the people of book as Allah said in the Quran. Making mistakes in the past and repenting is as if those sins were not committed."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, No this is incorrect.  The Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam says &quot;whoever changes his religion then kill him&quot; He didn't say if he helps the enemies or so. The one who helps the enemies of Islam should be killed even if he's a muslim!"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   There's nothing wrong with remembering Allah Subhanahu Wata'la. But you can't specify a number without an evidence, why you say it 100 times instead of 33 or 60?  Pondoring on the meaning of the thikr is also a good thing when you try to reflect on what does it mean but again this should not lead you to innovations like the people who say after 10 minutes I start seeing the Ka'ba or so!   Naming it Wathifa or duty or assignment doesn't matter. Names can vary but the actions that count."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   I don't know any authentic evidence for what you mentioned."
Isam Rajab,Salamu Alaikum  Can a sister get khulah for any reason?
Isam Rajab,"Yes I agree that he can't be both if it's one story with one group of people but it's not! This is the problem with some people who have shallow thinking and narrow minds ( And I'm sure you're not of them). Nuh (Noah) Peace be upon him kept calling people to the true religion for 950 years! So it's obious that within 950 years there's more than one conversation and one scene. I don't think anyone would think that within 950 years there's only one group and one conversation. Also, if you check more than one translation, you'll find a different interpretation for this word (Izdujir) you'll find : repulsed, rebuked, threatened and you'll find also driven out which is not a good translation actually.  The word comes from the root ZAJAR which means rebuke. Nevertheless, there's no contradiction even if it's driven out."
Isam Rajab,"Assalamau Alaykum,  I have a question with regards to this hadeeth:   The Prophet  (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “For one of you to be struck in the head with an iron needle would be better for him than touching a woman who is not permissible for him.” Narrated by al-Tabaraani from the hadeeth of Ma’qil ibn Yasaar; classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, no. 5045.  [Ref.  http://63.175.194.25/index.php?ln=en...QR=2459&dgn=4]   Sometimes, when you go to a store and need to purchase something, you get change back and the person giving you back the change is a woman and your hands may touch for a moment until she gives the change back.  Does this hadeeth apply to this situation?  And if so, what should be done because sometimes it is unavoidable.  BarakAllaahu Feekum."
Isam Rajab,asc wr wb       If you are muslim and you are stuck to the deen and there is one thing you did wrong and it is very bad. When you die and Allah questions you on the day of judgement.You say the truth not but the truth You say &quot;I did one thing wrong.&quot; is Allah going to forgive that person are they going to Heven or Hell?
Isam Rajab,"Assalam Alaikum Shaykh,  Mashallah I know you are a person who has sound knowledge of the 4 major madhahib, and for this reason I wanted to ask you the following questions:  1.  I've heard that once the Rasoul (SAAS) combined Zhuhr and 'Asr in Zhuhr's time for no reason.  Is this true, and if so can one combine Maghrib with Isha?  I'm not talking about travel prayers, but rather praying the complete unshortened prayers.  There are some of us who have classes during Asr time so we combine the full 4 rakat of Asr with Zhuhr.  I was wondering if the same could apply To Maghrib and Isha as well.  2.  If there is a man (and no other men), can he lead a woman (who is not his mehram) in Salaat?  Jazakallahkheir."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, If you borrow money and you pay it back with interest then it's haram and you can't do it. Also, I don't believe it's your money. You may be the benificiary but you're not the sole owner of that money yet because this money is kept with an agency or a department. Therefore, you have to avoid paying any interest."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Yes it's ok."
Isam Rajab,"as salam alaykum   Sheik, are there any hadiths that the Nabi [saw] used the words &quot;kafir&quot; towards anyone?  shukran  as salam alaykum"
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam,   Scholars have two opinions in regards to women visiting the cemetary &quot;graves&quot;.  one opinion says it's forbidden whatsover according to the authentic hadeeth narrated by Abu dawood: &quot;Allah curses women who visit graves&quot;.   another opinion says it's allowed &quot;but they have to maintain modesty and aviod any inappropriate action&quot; and this is what I believe is the right opinion for the following:   1- once the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam entered the Baqi' cemetary in Madina during the night and Aisha followed him and when he came back he didn't tell her why did you enter the graves while it's forbidden! this hadeeth is in Sahih Al bukhari.   2- once the Messenger Sallallahualiahi wasallam passed by a woman sitting next to a grave crying so he advised her to be patient. &quot;Bukhari and Muslim&quot; if it's not allowed to visit the graves the Messenger Sallallahualaihi wasallam would simply tell her she can't sit here before he tells her to be patient.   3- At the beginning of Islam it was forbidden to visit the graves as the Messenger Sallallhualiahi wasallam said: &quot;I used to prevent you from vising the graves&quot;. but then it became permissible, so probabely the hadeeth mentioned women in particular and that time.   I don't encourage women though to visit the graves since they can easily lose patience but I can't say it's forbidden for them to visit the graves."
Isam Rajab,"Walaikum Assalam, Unfortunately, I don't have any resources in English, there are few articles written, one of them is very precious for sh. Abdullah ibn Munai' but it's in Arabic.  If you're not a student of knowledge or a person of authority in your community then I advise you to go with the group where you are."

caramel,"I had such a fun night. I went to see the Three Musketeers perfomed in my school. It was AMAZING. I lauged and smiled so much and during intermission, everyone was joyfully talking about the acting of the French King. His wardrobe and wig made the actor resemble Captain Hook from Peter Pan. He was sooooooooooooooooo fruity. His entrance opens as he is dancing. His back is facing the audience and then he turns and makes this silly face. Oh my god. It was soooo funny. During Intermission, I was trying to mimick his goofy face but then I realized that the room had cameras and I didn't want some security to be laughing at me. He begins to play cards with his wife when he is interrupted by the evil Cardinal. The Cardinal reminds him: &quot;You are the most JUST king&quot; and the king adds &quot;And the most CHASTE&quot; and the wife gives a look to the audience and then the king breaks off and says to his wife: &quot;I want a heir whenver he plans to arrive&quot; And in other scenes as the dress maker is helping his wife try on some lace, the king is so bashful and looks away and it's just so funny. How clueless he is. And in another scene, there is a ball and no one has arrived but the king and he says to the Cardinal &quot;Come and watch me dance&quot; LOOOOL. And in the last scene, there is a war and the Cardinal tells the King to look at how the French are victorious and the King takes his telescope and looks out to the audience and looks at the Cardinal even though he's right next to him. lol.   And then, yay, the play ended. 10000% enjoyable and I came home at 12:30. and now Im stick with a 4 page paper on two museums. WOOO HOOO."

caramel,"Nicely put. Mahsallah.    Quote:     Originally Posted by  Shajaa3ah   All the posts in support of the notion that 'love stinks' seem to be levelling blame against an entity that cannot be blamed.  If a person becomes hurt by the actions of another as a result of loving them, then the love cannot be blamed. The person they love is the culprit. Love is an emotion, a feeling, which in itself is beautiful and cannot stink, just like happiness is beautiful, just like sadness is beautiful, and just like anger is beautiful. When anger is the emotion which is aroused against an injustice and oppression, it is beautiful, but the  expression  of that anger in the wrong way may be ugly. Yet the anger itself - the entity, the emotion - cannot be to blame, it is the individual who is unable to control his anger who is to blame. This holds true for all emotions and feelings - they cannot in themselves 'stink', then cannot be blamed or hated on.  If love causes hurt, it is not the love to blame, it is the object of one's love that is to blame, or it is loving the wrong person that is to blame, or it is the ill-expression of the love that is to blame, or it is the unrequitedness of the love that is to blame.. or any other such reason. But the common factor in all these instances - and all others - is that the culprit is a person, not a feeling or an emotion.  So it is people who stink, not love. Finding a person who does not stink and sharing [requited] love is among the most beautiful feelings and emotions Allaah has placed in the hearts of men. To say it stinks almost seems an expression of ingratitude."

Loliness: I want to be more social and be a good conversationist.  In real life and online, it takes me a long time to become friends with people. People think I'm either very shy and nice, quiet with an evil side, or am an arrogant *itch. So yes, I need to work on my social skills and mingling with girls. I'm really good freinds with Qudsiyah and it took me a year to im her on msn and build the relationship. In real life, it takes me a long time to open up to people and become friends with them.

I hope I become friends with some of them.    There are others who I am harsh too because of personality clashes but I am glad I've improved my relationship towards them a bit. I've changed so much and I've learnt a lot. I realized that in friendships, it takes two to tango. I complained so much how someone just doesn't get anything. Why can't they be more caring?And then I realized if I can make the person feel cared for, then I will be loved in return. I've worked several places before but none of them gave me the ride that my job has.   Alhamdolillah."

It's sucks that we have to end this relationship not based on how awful we feel around each other but because of people, their talks and their beliefs. On my ride home, I kept trying to smile and be calm before I broke him the news. When I finally reach the store some people see me and ask me if I had work today and are curious as to why I even came. When I reached downstairs where he works it turns out he left the job early as his sister is hospitalized  . I leave the store right away and of course more people see me. As soon as I come home, some lady called my mom to tell her that I went to work to see him and how everyone at work is now talking about my arrival.   My mother starts to yell and hit me and I try to convince her that I came to see him only to end it. The poor thing will be more stressed tomorrow when everyone will tell him that I came. I made the guy a celebrity and he's more terrified than I am. I really hope that this Friday I will successfully tell him what to do and he and I will proceed to tell people it's over. At the end of Ramadan, I hope the store returns to being normal and that he becomes Muslim.   May Allah give him hidayah and increase his liking for me. Ameen May Allah make people disinterested in us Ameen."

caramel,"Bismilahir Rahmanir Raheem, Assalaamu alaikom wa rahamatullahi wa barakatoh,    Covering Our Sisters: An Islamic Clothing Drive is in desperate need of donations both of clothing and in monetary form. Donations from 5$ to 20$ would greatly help along with donations of used, but in good condition hijabs, niqabs, shirts, skirts, pants, overgarments, etc. Prayer rugs are also needed as a welcome gift for new sisters. Please visit the VOLUNTEER page if you can help out by volunteering as well. InshaAllah khair    The website is still underconstruction :   http://www.geocities.com/covering_our_sisters/    You can email me or  covering_our_sisters@yahoo.com  for more information.    Covering Our Sisters is a charity project by Salaam Centre Canada* dedicated to helping Muslim women acquire Islamic clothing so they may observe proper Islamic hijab.    Numerous clothing banks exist, but few are able to meet the needs of Muslimahs. Muslimahs need loose, modest, clothes to conceal their bodies and protect their chastity; hence, the reason for the creation of Covering Our Sisters.  Covering Our Sisters was founded by a revert sister who experinced first hand the need for modest clothing when she reverted. While she was graciously recieved with the helping arms of her beloved sisters, she quickly realised the need to help other sisters who were not as fortunate.  Covering Our Sisters is currenly only sending items to sisters in Canada and the United States. Items can also be picked up in the GTA (Greater Toronto Area) instead of mailed.     http://www.geocities.com/salaam_centre_ca"

Wear an Abyaah and just shove it(No offence :P)     Some of the designs the abayaahs have are incredibly beautiful. When I was working, no one has ever said anything bad about abyaahs. EVERYONE who commented always said: Wow, that's pretty. (Even if my abayaah was just some simple gray thing and some black or sky blue scarf.) And at work, if I wore one of them black abyaahs with pretty embroidered borders around it, EVERYONE was like: Woah, that so beautiful. And will remember that specific dress DAYYYYYYYYYYYS after, and would still be like: That dress was truely beautiful.     One of the main reasons that I told you about the interviewing process for the school position is to tell you that the resume and interview are far more important than wearing the abayaah. Just look as nice as possible, wear clean ironed clothes. And Abayaahs makes the girls look professional as the brother said.    http://jelbab.com/catalog.asp?id=ABA  Check this and other websites out for Muslimah clothing.

My friend knows how much I hate working at the customer service section( exhanges, returns, sales, annoying phone calls, the head manager walking by,   [edit]   customers). I panic and have a fear that I will be sent there every time I work . She's so nice. She knows I can't take customer service and tells the managers she will do it  .  .   I like her mother as well. Even with me working only two days and even with new employees constantly being hired, people always talk about me even if it's untruthful. I get too much attention. Her mother heard some woman talking behind my back and scolded her right there and when some other woman was showing me attitude, she complained to her daughter the whole ride home how rude she was."

This hadeeth was classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami, 6471)    “Whoever reads Soorat al-Kahf on the day of Jumu’ah, will have a light that will shine from him from one Friday to the next.”  (Narrated by al-Haakim, 2/399; al-Bayhaqi, 3/249. Ibn Hajar said in Takhreej al-Adhkaar that this is a hasan hadeeth, and he said, this is the strongest report that has been narrated concerning reading Soorat al-Kahf. See: Fayd al-Qadeer, 6/198. It was classed as saheeh by Shaykh al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 6470)   It was narrated that Ibn ‘Umar (may Allaah be pleased with him) said:  “The Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ‘Whoever reads Soorat al-Kahf on the day of Jumu’ah, a light will shine for him from beneath his feet to the clouds of the sky, which will shine for him on the Day of Resurrection, and he will be forgiven (his sins) between the two Fridays.’”"

caramel,What color is  your phelgm? &quot;Healthy&quot; phlegm is normally clear or white. Yellow phlegm is normally a sign of an  infection . Greenish or brownish phlegm is nearly always a sign of infection. Greenish or  rusty  phlegm or phlegm with rusty spots can also be a sign of  pneumonia . Coughing up brown phlegm is also a common symptom of  smoking  too much. This is due to  resin  sticking to the viscous texture of the phlegm and being ejected by the body. Phlegm may be a carrier of  larva  of  intestinal parasites  (see  hookworm ).

Inshallah)    Tuna Sanwich Meal:   A) 1) After draining the excess water/oil from the tuna fish, put it in a bowl and mix in a lot of mayo. 2) Toast 2 Wheat Bread slices on one side. 3) When the sliced bread is toasted, put a lot of mayo on one side of one slice. 4)  Place in tuna on the other slice.  5)  Put in ketchup. If you like tomatos, lettuce,etc.place that in as well. 6)  Stick both slices together and stick a toothpick in the middle. And cut diagnolly.  B) Take a pickle and cut in half. C) Pour yourself a soda drink.  Enjoy.  p.s. I suggest making 2 sandwhiches."

caramel,"Question :          Is it ok for a wife to pray in the house behind her husband while he leeds the prayer?   Can you please give me any hadiths or ayats supporting this?       Answer :        Praise be to Allaah.    If a woman prays in jamaa抋h (congregation) behind her husband, he should stand in one row and she should stand in another behind him. Ibn Rushd (may Allaah have mercy on him) said in Bidaayah al-Mujtahid, 1/361)   慖 do not know of any difference of opinion about the Sunnah that a woman should stand behind the man or men, if there is another man besides the imaam, or behind the imaam if she is alone. This is known from the hadeeth of Anas which was reported by al-Bukhaari, in which he said that the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) led him and his mother and maternal aunt in prayer: 揌e made me stand on his right, and made the woman stand behind us.?This was also reported by Maalik, according to whom he said: 揑 and the orphan stood behind him (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), and the old woman stood behind us.敀   Elsewhere he said: 慣here is no difference of opinion regarding the fact that  a woman on her own should pray behind the imaam,  and that  if there is another man present, he should stand beside the imaam and  the woman should stand behind him  .?    This is the opinion of   all four Imaams  . And Allaah knows best.       Islam Q&amp;A   Sheikh Muhammed Salih Al-Munajjid  www.islam-qa.com"

Generally, a servant would feed, teach, and look after the children, when they get out of hand - she doesn't dare touch them. So she reports them to the parents and they take care of it. Same with the mother who reports and threaten to &quot;tell baba&quot;. Unfortunately sometimes the mother makes it even worse, she uses that threat to get the child to do things. Let's say the child got in a fight, so the mother goes, &quot;You better do this or that, or else ...I'll tell baba about your fight&quot;, which is pathetic.   But what can you do, they are women after all.   Moreover,  the father becomes the whip. Just the mention of his name, sends shivers across the entire house.  He becomes more like a police officer, or an official. Everything in his presence should be perfect.  Once he is gone, everyone relaxes and takes a deep breath of relief.

Take not as (your) Bitanah (advisors, consultants, protectors, helpers, friends, etc.) those outside your religion (pagans, Jews, Christians, and hypocrites) since  they will not fail to do their best to corrupt you . They desire to harm you severely. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, but what their breasts conceal is far worse. Indeed We have made plain to you the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses) if you understand.  As the brother mentioned already, it is commanded on us to not become friends with kafirs as they will corrupt as. Yes, there is a chance that we can give them dawah well, and they can abandon their evil ways and become on the SiratulMustaqeem. However, if we can rub on them, they can also rub on to us. Maybe get into our heads how can homosexuality be such a bad thing as murder, and rape and stealing.  Speaking generally of kafirs, they really do corrupt their muslim friends. The other day, I was sitting in the school audiotorium with a bunch of girls and was for some reason counting around me all the &quot;muslim girls&quot;. There were like 7 muslim girls and about 3 hindu/christain girls whom the muslims took as friends. Many of them started as girls with hijabs on. Now most of them abandoned it and became just like their freinds. Having bfs, going to prom and stuff.  :mad:"

But, I dont want that to happen when it comes to learning about Islam. Some of you over here are very brilliant at absorbing information and I want to do that.  When I was enrolled into Ap English class, the brilliant teacher made me learn how to read and get into character. She would tell us of all the hints,etc to make the books enjoyable...such as making note of the clothes the character wears and what does that really say about him. Etc. Because of her teaching ability, reading books became enjoyable and I got  A LOT from following her method. It's fun to get into the person's character and to feel the happiness and sorrow that he does.   However, with Islamic books, it's boring. The information is interesting and all and the way the author explains it is AMAZING, but I cant seem to enjoy the book. Or really absorb information.   It's like reading some boring, impersonal, mechanical instruction booklet. Like A) so and so meansso and so. B) Because of this defintion, so and so must be understod. C) if we dont understand so and so, everything is futile,etc. &lt; So boring!  Someone said to make yourself have interest in the book, and read it.

Some 10 year old boy thought I was 12 :O!    (best eid ever).  Than, I went online and told some sister about the happiest Eid of my life. She thought for some stupid reason that I was trying to make her jealous( cos she has severe family issues in her home, and with her self), and ended our friendship due to EID!  Mashallah."

caramel,"Weeks ago I went shopping with my mother who annoyed me over every article of clothing I wanted to purchase. I managed to get a few t shirts and some skirts. I'm never really in the house so I would wear my pink skirt every night before I go to bed and one day she just threw it into the hamper. I took out my yellow skirt to wear. The material wasn't as comfortable and I got some spill on it. I threw it into the hamper and my bran new yellow skirt comes back faded and has all these black/blusish marks all over it!  I'm so upset and I told my mom to fix it. She kept repeating how nothing would fix it. I told her to buy yellow dye and fix it but she isn't helping. She's blaming me for not washing clothes when it isn't my job to. The days when clothes are washed, I come home at 11p.m. or 12a.m., only for me to roll out of bed and have another exciting day.   I'm so angry.My money, my time getting the skirt and the cloth is ruined.   This is the third article of clothing they have ruined. My only yellow t-shirt was ruined the same way and now my yellow skirt.   IS there any way to fix it?"
caramel,"A) Marriages occur in Islam with the consent of two parties: the wali(guardians) of the girl and of the girl herself, where as with the men I dont think he needs the permission of his guardians. The reason for this is because girls are more likely to marry off some abusive jerk. Her guardians consent aims at trying to protect her from being in a marriage to the wrong guy. (While I was working, one of the kafirs coworkers explained how her cousin married without her family's permission to some messed up, abusive guy...only to end up being killed along with her unborn child.) But sometimes, some parents refuse guys based on their own perferences like the guy is too ugly, or not rich or a different race.   The guaridans can't literally force her to marry some boy if she doesnt wan't to.(Although, some people do it like that.) If she refuses whom her parents suggest, there is no sin upon her and she shouldn't feel guilty. I believe what we meant by arranged marriages is what Ibn Mardiyah said. In my case, my parents spoke to me of some 24 year old studying medicine who comes from a well to do family. If I agreed to marrying him, it would be considered ""arranged"" as my parents were the ones who introduced me to him.   B) On the dowry, the (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “The best of mahrs is the simplest (or most affordable).” Narrated by al-Haakim and al-Bayhaqi, classed as saheeh by al-Albaani in Saheeh al-Jaami’, 3279.  basically advising the to be wives to ask their husbands whatever will be easiest on them. My friend asked her husband for his Islamic book collection. Some sisters asked for some several hundred dollars. Others asked for a ring. And others asked for 2 abayaas(Islamic clothing), and some just asked their husbands to teach them the quran in arabic."

And in it there is a sadness that can not be removed except with the happiness of knowing Allah and being true to Him. And in it there is an emptiness that can not be filled except with love for Him and by turning to Him and always remembering Him.

If they arent attending college, they work as a dentist or nurse or something. They themselves are attending Islamic classes, whether it be online or in their masjid and are doing Very Well in them. They also play a very active part in making sure their children are well educated in secular studies and Islamic ones( Some mother and daughter took some Islamic classes, her young dauhgter got such niiiiice tajweed than her own mum!)  Also, they participate in activites like helping to organize events and what not.    ^ I want/need to be like the above.

I got an exam on Thursday and I'm stressed."
caramel,Alhamdolillah.
caramel,"I have an exam and paper due Tuesday. A exam Thursday where I will not get to see the finale episode of my favourite show in the whole world. And an Exam the next Thursday. So yes.   May Allah(swt) help Islaami  , myself and others pass their exams with 80 or better. Ameen."

caramel,"I voted the third one. Some time ago, I told this newbie worker that because he gets along with my friend and I, it makes him our co-husband. He's like: huh? And then i gave a long baffling explanation saying: You know co-wife is how a man can have many wives kinda thing? Ok well...my friend and i dont get along with the same people usually so this is new. You're our cohusband...co wife...something like that. and the guy adds in: You could've just said: coworker.   :S"

caramel,"How can I help myself?    I need to help myself become an excellent student.            I have lost my scholarship and I find it difficult to study and do any homework.     My friend wants to be in my place and just study and I rather be in his place and just work. I realize that if I just work, I won抰 get much of an income and I won抰 have other opportunities to expand myself. But I don抰 enjoy college. My parents are constantly forcing me to join an accounting club, get an internship, and apply for a one day bank job. I don抰 like the atmosphere or the people. I come to school wearing an astronaut suit and I hate having to socialize.            I don抰 see how I can enjoy my college life. I have a lot of law homework to do and I should read a chapter on accounting, yet I am unable to do my work. I become so distracted and I look for excuses so I wouldn抰 have to study."
caramel,Mak You can post in the Q &amp;A section. Only a certain few have been given the privleage to do so. And you ain't one of them.
caramel,Why not have a class one day of the week( after the salah?) The Brothers can leave off to wherever and some one amongst you girls can teach them something on Islam like the message of the prophet(saw). I noticed that in my schoo's msa a lot of girls who dont cover just come and listen and talk to each other before and after the class and some have become friends now.
caramel,"Assalmaualikum. I am asking on behalf of some brother who can not connect to the websites, but is able to sign on MSN. He says he has a wireless internet with a USB adopter. Can you guys please explain what the problem is and what can be done about it without going into too much detail?"

caramel,"Muslim A says or does something to offend( mistake or intentional) Muslim B.  Muslim A refuses to apologize for the damage that has been done firmly believing:  A) If you allowed some words to get to you, its your problem. B) If you cant get over it, its your problem.    Muslim A doesnt regret what she has done. She rarely apologizes and when she does, she rarely means it.  Muslim A was told by some respectable brother some time ago that there is no such &quot; small thing&quot; in Islam. All deed will be held accountable for.   Despite her attitude, she fears being held accountable and punished for her words and actions. So if she says: Astagfiruallh, is it ok? Will she be forgiven?even though she doesnt regret the &quot;harm&quot; she did and still finds that muslim so pathetic to be and remain angry?"

The kafir man is reading the newspaper on the stocks  The muslim decides that he can use the time to give dawah, so he starts off the conversation by commenting on how the stocks have been going down lately.  The Kafir man looks at him and two begin to talk about the stocks, politics, society and their conversation goes in the direction of Islam.   At the end, the kafir man says: hey this is my stop. nice chatting to you. I think Im gonna go and check out the local masjid    Yes yes  It would be cool if the muslim in your video was an ex-catholic as I know people who have become a bit relgious after the Pope died."

caramel,"Another idea(got this idea from Mc) The setting could take place at work Hot chick, men, a muslim man. The beautiful woman notices all the men look at her, some talk to each other or to their clients in their langauges( ex:Moma maldito, atractivo... Ella es tan caliente.) and some go mack on her:    How to mack:  Call her by her name... &quot;See you later, Elaine&quot;  Compliment on something specific like her smell, eyes, face Be direct &quot;Give me your number&quot; Make dirty jokes/noises, and she will find them funny, instead of being disgusted. Tell her to look beautiful tomorrow the way she looks today    Anyways, the woman gets all sorts of compliments from everyone, but the muslim man. She wonders why he doesn't look at her and doesn't talk to her. She wonders if she isn't beautiful enough. So one day she just confronts him and asks why he doesnt give her any attention. And he nobly replies, you are someone's daughter, sister what right do I have to look at you?  She was shocked, and day by day their conversations grew on islam and than she converted, they married, and live happily ever after   or she is surprised, their conversations grow on about islam, she comes to work one day with a scarf on. The Muslim man is sooo happy and is like: Why are you covered for? And she says: I want to be a modest good woman. They married, and live happily after."

What I dont get is if we were created for worship and for the obedience of Allah(swt) in all affiars as best as can and if the whole society was to do just that, why would Allah(swt) rather want us weak so that we could ask for forgiveness,etc. Does He just want to exercise His power?

caramel,"Walakum Assalam Wharamatulillah Wabarakatuhu  The best way to get a job is to have the right connections.  A) I was first employed in a hospital after I told some teacher that I'm interested in using my time to earn money.She found some program that helps students get jobs. So through her, I got employment.  B) The current job is in some medical clinic. Though in a different city. I got this job through my father. He knows that his company( a union) always hires high school graduates during the summer so he made me and my brother fill out job applications. I got the job. I thought I would work in the same building as my father, but alhamdolillah I'm not.  C) Before I got this job, I asked some guy I know from MSN that I want to be employed. He said that where he works( a store) that they are hiring and gave me their number and address to go call them up and come there to sign up an application. But since I have the job now, I told my mother to go in fill out the forms, and get employed.  D) One of my classes in highschool the teacher brought up news that us students can go every few weekends to some intern training classes. Like how to dress professionally,etc. and once we complete the classes they will hire us in some banks and what not. Or he would say, so and so club is looking for employeed. and those interested would find out about the job and sign up.  E) Most classmates got jobs through their buddies. While in the locker rooms, they would talk about where they work and some one will bring up the fact that they need money or are seeking employment. So because of this, someone got hired in Mcdonalds and some 99cents store. Some girl gave me the numbers of eye doctors, dentists who want students to be hired.  F) You can go to your local library and tell them you want to be hired."

caramel,"Have to write a paper analyzing two films.  I've seen during the weekend some film entitled: &quot;The Human Stain&quot;, starring Nicole Kidman and Anthony Hopkins. It seems to me the movie is about escaping from reality. For example, the main character hides from the world, includhing his own wife that he's really a Negro. Another character who is by profession a writer hides somewhere in the middle of the woods after his divroces/cancer.  The movie comes to an end where the main character( Hopkins and Kidman) are killed in a car accident. As a result of their death, the writer and others become free and benefit from their death, and I guess by the main characters dying they also become free from their past. So I'm thinking that the point of the film is: &quot;Why ain't a man truly happy unless he dies? Oh Why? Time.&quot;   Anyways, recommend me another movie dealing with hiding one's identity and the results that brings."

caramel,"Today I laughed because people at work are convincing me that I'm coldblooded and evil. I'm so blunt that these employees are beginning to tell potential customers how I judge. (Normally when I am advertising the re-touch up, I pick a picture of some coworker whose face wasn't touched up and I point out to her pores, pimples and bumps and compare it to the touched up picture. Hopefully the customer walks away realzing that even though her face wasn't thaaaat bad, with the touch up, it looks ten times better.) To the coworkers, they think I'm mean so I started to act mean :S. One time this girl mentioned that her boyfriend isn't something she would normally be attracted to because of his race and when I saw him today, I told her: Your funny looking boyfriend is here and that he must come across as a hobo. And all that gayness. So yeah loool.   And this girl at work, lol. She loves to pick on me because I'm easy to pick on. lol.  She's always talking about mopping the floors and toes and one day she asked me so sincerely if I am leaving. And I thought she was so interested in me going away and after I'm like: yeah..she replies: &quot;So your not gonna mop the floor&quot; looool.   And One time at work I was looking for my purse and the manager and this other girl says: They threw the bag out. And Im thinking: what? :S Did my bag look trash to them? And I walk out to the back and am looking through the garabge bags until one manager walks to me and she's like: Your actually going through the trash? They were joking? And Im like: OMG. WHY? I'm so gullible. And she's like: That's what I told them. And When I saw the other manager and coworker, I was so red and kept looking down and my boss goes like: I would do the same if i was tricked like that. lol."

I already have taken MTH 2610, but I can still get into MTH 2206.  Does this mean I have to take another Math level?

May Allah(swt) guide him. Ameen. Now in college, I took college physics and calculus and even though my grades aren't As, and I handed in some material late, and some material I didn't hand in at all, I enjoyed the classes and looked forward to attending my next class.   I am glad my school is coming to an end this week. This semester didn't go well as the first.  My grades weren't as good, and I handed a lot of work in late.  I learnt that I will not take credits over 15, take classes that I will enjoy, come home before 6p.m. I'm already a lower sophmore.   Inshallah, when school reopens I will take good classes and will participate more in the activites my school offers.    I've been sick for several weeks and inshallah all of this sadness will go once school is finished. I can't wait to get a job and have some money,excersize more, read 2 books,get a driver's licence, join the gym, learn to swim and paint and spend money on things that will make me happy( and not just for school).

caramel,"I think Islamic Talk is wonderful because I get to learn neccesary life skills( such as if I want to enroll my children in public or Muslim school), the forums also provide indepth debates about any subject, and that it makes me wish I can be an eloquent writer. I got my life from I.T.   The other most visited forum I go to is Reviving Islam. I got my deen from R.I. What I like about it is that some members are highly knowledgable and they always answer questions in a cool way. (Ex:ibn zareena) They are highly critical of the kafir life and muslims who aren't relgious.I also like how some members give us a new way of thinking about something haraam. On Paltalk one of them said that those who fornicate are like dogs who go around shagging anything. That made me not want to do that haraam  .  What I don't like about them is that they whine a lot. Before R.I. was transformed, they has some thread in one of the sections about body piercings. Some of us said that muslimahs shouldn't have piercings(belly piercing) done because it is imitating kafirahs and the piercing isn't even common in our culture. Some one replied saying that it is fine because it is considered decortation and will be for the husband. Now on Ri, some sisters are so heated and think piercings are haraam since having a nose pierced,etc. will equate to the girl changing her form. :/"

caramel,"Buying a review book and using your learning style really helps.   I was lost in my Law class and we had a final on about 10 chapters. I didn't have the energy nor the time to read the lenghty and difficult chapters and alhamdolillah someone told me I should buy Barron's Business Law (review book). I bought the book, went to the end of the book and looked up the pages for the material I needed to know for the final. I read only those portions, took notes and kept repeating and thinking about what I learned. The Law final went pretty well. Alhamdolillah.   My friend was discussing on paltalk how she would study for her exams. One of her technique was to write questions about what she just read. So if her book dealt with Germany wanting to win the war, she would write down &quot;Who believed they could win the war?&quot; My economics teacher always gave review questions to the chapters we covered and I didn't look at them until after my friend told mer her technique. I first went over and memorized a few facts from my own notes and then read over the questions and the answers that was discussed in class and then I re-wrote out those answers memorizing along the way and alhamdolillah this eco. exam wasn't as bad as the others."

I sat in a pod and this girl sat next to me. Her sisters sat in the adjacent pod. As the ride began to spun fast, I like the others was screaming. When the ride slowed down for a small moment to pick up more passengers I automatically tried to save myself. I slammed the girl on to her seat, held her arm and put my head on her shoulder. I shut my eyes and tried to keep my mouth shut.  I just wanted to make through the ride alive.   I was so quiet that my friend thought  I died.  She kept asking me if I was okay. I got annoyed by her questions. I thought if I spoke I would die. So I yelled out: Shut up.   When the ride was done, she was startled at my behavior and said she was just making sure if everything was okay with me. And for this other ride, I behaved similarly.   When we got on a rollercoaster ride, I loosened up and was screaming with my eyes wide open. But my voice is high pitched, imho so I tried to not scream so loud.   My fav. ride was the bumper rides cos Im good at driving and I had so much fun hitting people."

I felt a bit sad that I wouldn't get any worthy commision from her but you know, I'm glad that despite her physcial appearance and not having a lot of money and all, she wanted to get her picture done and even though we didn't earn a lot from her, she could have spend her money in ANY way but she came to us and, and she had the most friendliest personality and I hope that Allah(swt) gives her hidyaah and make her one of the most gorgeous and happy women in jannah.   And after she left, I thought of Islaaami."

And she would pick up the children of other people thinking it would be hers. Eventaully, she finds her own child and begins to take care of him. And to this the Prophet(saw) questioned the shahbah and asked something like: Do you think this mother would throw her child into hell? The shahbah, after noticing the mother look for and love/take care of her found child replied: No!! The Prophet(saw) than said: Verily,Allah(swt) loves people more than a mother does.   Alhamdolillah.  Also rose, as much as you reveal yourself, its' seems like you do the deeds of Paradise. You seem to sincerely believe in Allah and you try to do good(I.e. memorizing Surahs,etc.) There's a hadeeth which says: Verily, if Allah created one of his servants for Paradise, He helps him do  the deeds of the people of Paradise until he dies doing on of hteir deeds, then He places him in Paradise because of it.

caramel,"The word beauty refers to an attribute that brings about attraction. To define what is beauty, we should refer it to the culture of the people.  Because culture differs, so do the opinions of men.   There was an experiment to test the relativity of beauty. One guy came up with template of the perfect face. Tested it out on Tom Cruise and other models and it fitted perfectly. But the flaw is that culture also defines beauty and cultures differ. Culture is man抯 most influential creation on himself. Therefor to relate to man, use culture. There must be some underlying features that we consider as beautiful. That抯 why we can collectively say someone is beautiful without much disagreement like for example Tom Cruise.   I thought beauty( in terms of love) was a proper example and I wrote the following on a napkin at 7 am: When you fall in love with someone, you fall in love with their beauty. Their beauty is just theirs. Their smile, attitue, personality character is just theirs. even if that person had a twin, their beauty is not the same. because its YOU has this     affect on me.  But that抯 superficial Love is not about beauty. If a person seeks certain things from their potential spouse such as intellectual intimacy, understanding, unconditional care. That抯 not beauty.  Its?phermones. People are attracted to something because their body said so by scent, sight, media influence."

When I was in public speaking class, we had to interview other students and do a speech about them. I interviewed an Egyptain girl and when I gave my speech, I was trying to &quot;act&quot; the reactions I had with meeting her. My frist impression of her was bad, so I made a disgusted face, and I kept doing these faces and people loved it.    Screw people.  Just do your best at what you had to do. They don't exsit. This masjid held a Eid party for women and they were trying to educate on the importance of covering by doing some skits and doing a fashion show displaying how women cover wrongly( i.e. wearing a net scarf). For the fashion show, I came out wearing a t-shirt, gold hoops and jeans and my hair was covered a bit. When the woman(mother of 3, and teacher at the masjid) introduced me and tried to make the audience guess why my dress was inappropriate. I kept rolling my eyes at her, and tried to indicate I'll beat her up ffor talking crap about me. Audience loved it. For the skit, I played a perverted man and was given only one line: &quot;ooo, I like highlights&quot;. Everyother &quot;boy&quot; dressed up in black baggy clothes, while I was unique(everyone in the audience was shocked with my appearance) and came out as a truck driver with a plaid shirt on and a baseball shirt beneath and just hit on the girls and did inappropriatestuff infront of the old aunties and their daughter's daughters.

caramel,"Instructions for selling at a fized price: Buy It Now  The Buy It Now feature lets you specify a price you will accept for your item. The first buyer who's willing to pay your price gets your item. Below are a couple of requirements you must meet before you can use the Buy It Now feature.  Fixed Price Format Requirements  To set a Buy It Now price, you need to meet at least one of these requirements:   Achieve a feedback score of at least 10.  Verify your contact information (using the ID Verify service).  If you have a PayPal account, achieve a feedback score of 5 and accept PayPal as a payment method.   How Buy It Now Works with Auction-style Listings  If a buyer is willing to meet your Buy It Now price before the first bid comes in, your item will sell immediately to that buyer, and your item listing will be considered complete.  Or  If a bid comes in first, the Buy It Now option disappears. In that case, the item listing will proceed normally. If you also have set a minimum price, or &quot;Reserve Price,&quot; the Buy It Now feature will disappear after the first bid is at least as high as the Reserve Price."

caramel,"My dreams are usually adventurous.   Today I had a fine dream. It started off with me being unhappy about my marriage. My husband travels to unknown islands and my entire relationship is a net one. I end up having an affair with a man who is about to be married. All we did was went to that unknown island to rooms we don't belong and then come back to USA. (nothing haraam happened) I sort of feel guilty and I almost confessed to my husband. Once I leave that man who was giving me the time of my life, I go back to the navy and these people wearing colorful outfits attack me. I get into a physical fight with a few of them and I lock them out. They all try to get in and are pushing as hard as they can and are ramming motorcycles into the door. I go ballistic and throw missiles at them. I single handly destroy their battleship and the unknown island. My own battleship begins to drown as well and I swim to resuce. I climbed some lighting post and wait for my mom and on her arrival I talk about my amazing day at work but all she says is 'Okay'. The dream ended with my ex-fiance wanting to get with this girl who had a heart/mental disease.     The end."

caramel,"From my love(Art History) class:   Christain work is Iconicm where it is writing through pictures. It's for lovers of human/animal art and it is for those who are illiterate.  In the early Christain art, God( in the heavens) was shown by his arm being extended from the sky.    Islamic art on the other hand is  ANICONIC . It is a  non-iconic word based art  written in different styles of writings. For example: The Walk Sign which shows a stick figure walking and beneath it is the word: WALK.The writings  are the sayings of the prophet( I.E. what the 5 pillars are) and verses from the Quraan.   The phrases appear in two styles: Kufic(square) and curvilinear.   Instead of human and animals desgins, Islamic art uses geometric designs. The geometric designs become complex as it is spread out.    The arches are sometimes alternations in rich colours. Criss-cross arches.  Arches coming from the capitals of colomns, previously used by pagans."

caramel,"In the Sealed Nectar, there is a section entitled:  The Tyrants Decision To Kill The Prophet   The following is from this part:  'Utaibah bin Abi Lahab once approached the Prophet (Peace be upon him) and most defiantly and brazenly shouted at him, &quot;I disbelieve in: &quot;By the star when it goes down.&quot; [53:1] and in &quot;Then he (Gabriel) approached and came closer.&quot; [53:8] In other words: &quot;I do not believe in any of the Qur'鈔.&quot; He then started to deal highhandedly with Muhammad (Peace be upon him) and laid violent hand on him, tore his shirt and spat into his face but his saliva missed the Holy face of the Prophet (Peace be upon him). Thereupon, the Prophet (Peace be upon him) invoked All鈎's wrath on 'Utaibah and supplicated:    &quot;O All鈎! Set one of Your dogs on him.&quot;   All鈎 responded positively to Muhammad's supplication, and it happened in the following manner: Once 'Utaibah with some of his compatriots from Quraish set out for Syria and took accommodation in Az - Zarqa'. There a lion approached the group to the great fear of 'Utbah, who at once recalled Muhammad's words in supplication, and said: &quot;Woe to my brother! This lion will surely devour me just as Muhammad (Peace be upon him) supplicated. He has really killed me in Syria while he is in Makkah.&quot; The lion did really rush like lightning, snatched 'Utbah from amongst his people and crushed his head      Two Questions: 1) Is the bolded dua that the prophet made considered a curse? 2) We can't make duas like these??"

The  nikah  took place between Shabnam hailing from a conservative Muslim family in Lucknow and Abdul Kalam, who are currently 3,500 miles apart.   At the time, Shabnam pronounced the words  nikah qubool hai  (the marriage is accepted), Abdul Kalam was in the city of Mecca.    Kalam is a computer engineer and belongs to Chennai. He has never visited Lucknow. He is at present working in Mecca.    The arrangement for the  nikah  was made at an internet caf?owned by one PN Mishra, where the couple saw each other through web cameras. Around 50 relatives of the bride were present at the cyber caf?along with a  Kazi  (cleric), who solemnised the marriage.    The  nikah  was solemnised as both the boy and the girl gave their consent to the wedding.    There is, however, some confusion about whether such a  nikah  is legal.     Maulana Khalid Rasheed Firangi Mahli, Naib Imam of the famous Aishbagh Idgah in Lucknow, and a prominent member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board says, &quot; Nikah  through the Net is perfectly valid and legal if there are two witnesses. Such a  nikah  is in accordance with the Islamic law.&quot;     A number of clerics, however, disagree with this viewpoint.     More clarity is expected when the All India Muslim Personal Law Board meet in Bhopal next a month."

His customer has a faulty phone and after having it reparied, he calls the person to ask if the phone is working fine now. The guy yells: Don't you have daugthers and mothers? How dare you call someone at their house!?  My prof.: I am calling from the office, not from my house to check up on your phone. And the customer still yells.   His employee calls him informing how as he is working on the telephpone poll, people below surround the poll abusing him with suspicion that the telephone line man is peeping into people's houses and daughters.    lol."

I was worried about how I will come across and especially worried how I would leave any impression if she were to ask what happened to the old job.   I came to the store and she sat me down and didn't really ask anything about me. Alhamdolillah. She talked so much and I tried to find a pause so I could show I'm a good worker. She just started asking when I would like to work and what I will have to do.  She gave me a phone script and said I had to come this Friday to be tested out.  I'm so glad I'm close to getting a job. Honestly, alhamdolillah that Allah(swt) got me out of that hell hole.    I couldn't take it anymore and opportunity came knocking on my door. Please continue to make dua."

Meanwhile at 5p.m. on Feb.2, B mailed the following letter to S: &quot;I accept your offer dated Feb.1.

After we measured the distance between all 18 dots, we made a chart with the following columns: time, time^2, and V=d/t. My brother told me to keep adding .025s to each data point. Than I just squred time for t^2 and I found V.  For example: For the 1st data pt, the distance was 1cm. The time was .025s, t^2 was .000625 and V was 40. For the second data pt., distance was 2cm, time was .05s, t^2 was .0025 and V was 40. The distance for the 3rd data pt. is 3.50cm, time is .05s and t^2 is .005625 and V is 46.667  Right so far? The second part of the assignment was to plot distance vs. time^2 and velocity vs. time."

I am so glad that the law department found the law final that I took in January. New York had a transit strike and our exams were postponed and the rooms were changed and I went to the original testing room unaware of the change. When the teacher there found out I was in the wrong room, he made me sign a piece of paper declaring that I was in the wrong room and I handed him in a bright yellow folder some project I owed my professor. Time went by and I didn't get my grade for law and I called the department and they said that my professor usually takes time handing in the grades. I waited. I checked my transcript again and I noticed for the law class they had an ABS as my grade standing for Absence and I was shocked. And I called nearly every week for months and months in hopes of the department finding my exam and project. I became busy with my school and work and I gave up hope thinking I would have to retake the law class again. I checked my transcript and I got a B in law class and earned my 60th credit and my gpa increased a wee bit."

caramel,"Assalamualikum.  Yesterday I was thinking why I became interested in Islam and the answer to that is because I felt there was a higher purpose in life even if all our goals are accomplished and records are broken,etc. And I want to further this thought...what makes one realize there is a higher purpose in life. So I asked my friend on msn:  &quot;You go outside to the busiest and biggest of cities And you pull people aside and ask them their purpose in life They will all say: I dont know. Despite having a job, having school, being married or being in a relationship and having a family of some sort. Each one complex,thought-provoking and has its ups and downs.  They still don't know their purpose in life. Even people in the big city, amazing architectures, the biggest and oddest of shopping places and parks and entertainment sections people still don't know their purpose in life So how does one realize that they were created for something more? There are also some people who have a &quot;passion:&quot; for something like music or the arts. They practise diligently and travel far and work hard and believe that their passion is their purpose in life and they are content.&quot;  She tried to explain that when people have suffered defeat find themselves unfulfilled, than they believe that their is a higher purpose in life. Why Islam?   So yea..answer me."
caramel,Talk about Isa(as) and Ibrahim(as) and the Prophet Muhammad(saw).   My friend whose a convert told me that reading about those 3 men shocked him.

I always hated the fact that as a christian i had to worship him.I just couldn't believe in him as 'God' but i could believe in him as a prophet&quot;  He also said reading about Muhammad(saw) as:  &quot;well when i just read about him he seemed like the pefect example of someone you want to live your life like.&quot;

An outcast from all you meet, you have very few friends who haven't  later backstabbed you in some way or another .  And  you've made your share of mistakes... a little torture, a little coercion, a little stealing, it was all part of a day's work. It's hard to say if it deserves the kind of treatment you're getting now, though.   When people look for someone to point to with a worse life than they have, they think  of you first.        You're India!     A great thinker and leader, you have a great deal of power despite  being really poor.   You like movies, cows, and you probably are a vegetarian and may  even be a pacifist.  You've probably been moving away from pacifism lately, though,  as you get more and more defensive that everyone around you is trying to hurt you.    How about a nice game of chess?        You're Pakistan!      You used to ask people what they thought about things, but quite  recently you've decided to just do stuff without asking nicely.   You really want to go  to the mountains, but for some reason, people won't let you, mostly because they won't let  acquire any nice sweaters.  In the meantime, you're avoiding alcohol and pork and trying  to balance eating right with not falling behind in your competition with your next-door  neighbor."

caramel,"If you can use a power point presentation during your speech, do so. Use funny pictures (I.e. Simpsons) People laugh and remember what your topic was about(a bit).  You don't necessarily have to look at people's faces. Just look at their foreheads or eyebrows.  Be careful of your hand gestures. Some people keeping putting their hands near their private parts :/   Write a good speech and prepare well. Be confident in what you have to say and how.   Emphasize words. Be louder in some parts and quieter in others. People wake up or at least begin playing closer attention to what you are saying.  Be easy on them. Be enjoyable to listen to.One time I was so unprepared for my speech, that I just sounded very angry and stern.   And some kids said that I was scaring them.   Study talk show hosts, or tv show hosts. Some of these people are just talking to the camera and they don't hear any responses. (I.e: Are we all ready to have a fun time?!(pause) YES we are!) Try to imitate their way of speaking their lines. Some sound like *itches, some sound so boring, some are too hyper, and some are perfect/comfortable. They get your attention, and make the show fun."

caramel,"Best advice  I used to put down into our appointment book customers who would not leave a $20 deposit in the hopes that if they come, I will get some credit for it and in the belief that ulitmately what they will spend is a lot of money. When the manager took over, he called every single one of those unsecured to confirm that they will come, all of them said NO and on that day, I had some paid customers who canceled their appointments and it hurt so much. I told one booker of my sorrow and she said that when she comes to work, she comes believing that she has already brought in a lot of customers and the rest are on their way.   I followed that advice. It works. Before when I was unabe to sell, I would stand with a frown folding my arms and now I  try to think positive about my situation and by being positive when all I have made is 1 or 2 sales helps me get a lot more customers who want to tour and who want to book. One day at work, that same girl who gave me the advice brought in a family who wanted to take their pictures and they waited a long time and their child was crying and they walked out on her. Common sense is that families spend more money on pics than individuals do on themselves. She lost a big sale and when I spoke to her about it, all she replied with is: My next big family is coming.    ABC used to whine a lot and I told her of how an older woman wanted to get into some finance and she was unsure of her success. She would repeat 25 times a day the mantra that she was young, beautiful and successful even though she wasn't. By keeping her mind positive and working smart, she eventually achieved succees."

As I stood in the long line to use the computer, there was a Spanish woman a bit behind me. She wore a tanktop which revealed her belly-button and short skirt. She was crying and very unstable. The woman in front of her was a  Christain black woman who wore a very modest dress. All she needed was a scarf on her head, and I would have confused her as a Muslimah in the summer heat. The black woman turned around and began talking to the disturbed girl. She spoke in a calm manner, very respective and mature. She asked the girl what was wrong, etc and the crying issue was over her boyfriend. After hearing this, she than spoke about her own experience with her boyfriends and about commiting zinna and what not. The girl listened....And than she revealed that because she started believing in christ, she cleaned up her act. She left her bf and said if he wants to see her, he can only see her if there is a 3rd party in the room. The girl's sobbing diminished a lot and she calmed down.  And I got to the computer thinking...Wow man...about how that woman spoke and how she calmed the girl down. And that prollly that girl was moved by the other's  talk and wants to know &quot;christ&quot;.    The Muslims can do the same. Be an example for the rest and what not,etc."

We believe what Allah(swt) said about them.

Ok, this is something I found on another forum. I found it benefical and I gues it sorta answers your question. so here:        we should remember that we love and hate for the sake of Allah. an atheist disbelieves in the existence of Allah so how can she be our friend, when this is her position with The Lord of the universe.? does Allah deserve to be thought of in this way and Allah feeds and clothes and gives respite to these atheists, yet they take His provision and deny Him. there is no love in our hearts for such people. but we can be kind and just towards them in our interacations without inviting them into our lives. the mushrik associates a partner with Allah worshipping His creation with Him. how sick is this? do we not feel sick at the thought that Allah is being treated in this manner? does Allah deserve this? to be associated with trees, and stones and idols and animals and humans and jinn and angels etc, when He is Allah. we cannot love such people but we can treat them with kindness and justice. and the jews mock Allah directly and the christians attribute a son to Him."
